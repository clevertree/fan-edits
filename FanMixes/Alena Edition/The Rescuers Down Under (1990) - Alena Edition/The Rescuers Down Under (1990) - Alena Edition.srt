1
00:02:07,502 --> 00:02:10,797
<i>Thundershowers are 
expected in the Crocodile Falls area</i>

2
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:14,384
<i>and some of the surrounding gullies, 
so take out your...</i>

3
00:02:19,097 --> 00:02:21,057
COdyI

4
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:22,267
Yeah, Mom?

5
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,728
- What about your breakfast? 
- I've got some sandwiches in my pack.

6
00:02:26,104 --> 00:02:29,232
- Be home for supper. 
- No worries, Mom.

7
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:48,293
I know, I'm coming.

8
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,546
Hustle up, Nelson. 
Faloo's sounding the call!

9
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:01,598
Come on, little Wombats, hurry!

10
00:03:16,446 --> 00:03:17,864
Who's caught this time?

11
00:03:17,947 --> 00:03:19,073
You don't know her, Cody.

12
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,701
Her name is Marahute, 
the great golden eagle.

13
00:03:21,784 --> 00:03:22,744
Where is she?

14
00:03:22,827 --> 00:03:25,872
She's caught, high on a cliff 
in a poacher's trap.

15
00:03:26,122 --> 00:03:28,708
- You're the only one who can reach her. 
- I'll get her loose.

16
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:31,794
Righto. Hop on, no time to lose.

17
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:54,984
She's up on top of that ridge. 
Be careful, little friend.

18
00:04:21,678 --> 00:04:23,680
Marahute!

19
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:38,152
Calm down, calm down.

20
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,904
I'm not gonna hurt you.

21
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:43,032
That's a girl. Stay still.

22
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,536
It's okay.

23
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,958
No, wait! I'm here to help you.

24
00:04:53,042 --> 00:04:54,711
Easy! Easy!

25
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:03,678
You're free!

26
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:04,614
Higher!

27
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,450
You're a mom!

28
00:08:16,329 --> 00:08:19,874
They're very warm. 
Are they gonna hatch soon?

29
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:37,099
Where's the daddy eagle?

30
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:44,190
My dad's gone, too.

31
00:10:00,474 --> 00:10:03,644
Help! Someone, help! 
McLeach took a little boy.

32
00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:05,146
Send for help!

33
00:12:12,106 --> 00:12:15,985
Code red, code red! Attention 
all Rescue Aid Society delegates.

34
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,363
<i>All delegates report immediately 
to the main assembly hall.</i>

35
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,198
<i>This is an emergency meeting.</i>

36
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:24,535
<i>I repeat, this is a code red 
emergency meeting!</i>

37
00:12:27,037 --> 00:12:28,372
<i>Order!</i>

38
00:12:28,873 --> 00:12:32,251
<i>Yes, I know it's late, but I'm... 
Really? Pajamas?</i>

39
00:12:32,334 --> 00:12:34,879
<i>Hello, Frank, how are you? 
Nice to see you!</i>

40
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:36,714
<i>And Esmerelda, there you are!</i>

41
00:12:36,964 --> 00:12:39,592
<i>Quiet now, please, 
everyone pay attention.</i>

42
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,428
<i>There has been 
a kidnapping in Australia.</i>

43
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,347
<i>A young boy needs our help.</i>

44
00:12:45,431 --> 00:12:48,809
<i>This is a mission 
requiring our very finest,</i>

45
00:12:48,893 --> 00:12:53,189
<i>and I know we are all thinking 
of the same two mice.</i>

46
00:12:56,650 --> 00:12:58,777
<i>What's this? Gone?</i>

47
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:02,907
<i>We must find Bernard 
and Miss Bianca at once!</i>

48
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:17,171
Pea soup.

49
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,350
Pea soup!

50
00:13:44,532 --> 00:13:48,911
To my dear Bernard, 
and our wonderful partnership.

51
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:52,665
Yeah, wonderful.

52
00:13:55,501 --> 00:14:00,339
You've been very quiet this evening. 
ls there something on your mind?

53
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:03,008
Well, actually...

54
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:07,012
- I was wondering... 
- Yes, darling?

55
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:10,182
I... Miss Bianca, would you...

56
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:12,977
Would you...

57
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,437
Would you excuse me for a minute?

58
00:14:33,747 --> 00:14:37,084
<i>Pardonnez-moi, Mademoiselle Bianca,</i> 
I <i>have important news.</i>

59
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:38,961
Yes, Frangois? What is it?

60
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,672
You and Bernard 
have been asked to accept

61
00:14:41,755 --> 00:14:44,258
a dangerous mission to Australia.

62
00:14:44,592 --> 00:14:48,637
The poor boy. This is dreadful.

63
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:51,515
Now where is Bernard? 
I must tell him at once!

64
00:14:51,765 --> 00:14:55,227
Allow me, madame, 
I will tell him immediately.

65
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,788
Miss Bianca, will you marry me?

66
00:15:14,872 --> 00:15:18,000
Quickly, Monsieur Bernard! 
I must speak with you.

67
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:21,754
- Not now, Frangois, I'm busy! 
- No, monsieur, you don't...

68
00:15:25,507 --> 00:15:29,386
- Bernard, did you talk to Frangois? 
- Yes, but there's something I want...

69
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:32,973
I know what you're going to say. 
Frangois told me about it.

70
00:15:33,182 --> 00:15:34,224
He did? How did he...

71
00:15:34,308 --> 00:15:37,770
it doesn't matter, 
I think it's a marvelous idea.

72
00:15:37,936 --> 00:15:39,146
You do?

73
00:15:39,563 --> 00:15:41,315
I mean, you really want to?

74
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:45,653
I don't think it's a matter of wanting, 
it's a matter of duty.

75
00:15:46,153 --> 00:15:49,031
Duty? I never thought of it...

76
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:52,868
Well, all right. 
How does next April sound to you?

77
00:15:52,951 --> 00:15:56,705
Heavens, no! 
We must act immediately, tonight!

78
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:59,667
Tonight? But wait!

79
00:16:00,167 --> 00:16:04,755
Bianca, this is so sudden. I mean, don't 
you at least need a gown or something?

80
00:16:04,922 --> 00:16:08,842
No, just a pair of khaki shorts 
and some hiking boots!

81
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,260
Hiking boots?

82
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:12,596
There you are.

83
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,932
Come along, come along.

84
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,147
<i>Delegates, we have 
an important announcement.</i>

85
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:27,152
<i>Bernard and I have decided 
to accept the mission to Australia.</i>

86
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,237
Australia?

87
00:16:28,362 --> 00:16:31,782
Good show! 
Now, you must fly out immediately!

88
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:35,452
It's a little nippy outside, 
but we won't let that stop us, will we?

89
00:16:49,758 --> 00:16:51,802
Miss Bianca, 
I'm not sure it's a good idea

90
00:16:51,885 --> 00:16:53,887
to fly this soon after eating!

91
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:56,390
Darling, you'll be just fine!

92
00:16:56,557 --> 00:16:59,685
But aren't you supposed 
to wait 45 minutes?

93
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:04,940
Just knock on the door 
and see if Orville is there!

94
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:10,863
Nobody's home, let's go.

95
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:15,909
This is no time to play in the snow.

96
00:17:16,577 --> 00:17:19,663
I wasn't playing in the snow. 
It was an avalanche.

97
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:21,874
Look, Bernard!

98
00:17:21,957 --> 00:17:24,918
"Under new management, see Wilbur."

99
00:17:29,173 --> 00:17:32,176
Come on, darling. Let's get a move out!

100
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:46,940
<i>I'm the cat's pajamas</i>

101
00:17:47,024 --> 00:17:49,234
<i>Always run around 
with crazy little mamas</i>

102
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:52,946
Mr. Wilbur!

103
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:54,740
Get down there, son!

104
00:17:54,823 --> 00:17:55,908
Hello?

105
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:59,787
Pick it, boy, pick it! Yeah!

106
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:05,125
Here we go! Let's walk!

107
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,798
Look out! Excuse me, sir.

108
00:18:10,881 --> 00:18:14,468
Do something! He can't hear us!

109
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:16,762
Big time, big time!

110
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,390
<i>The girls all look when I go by...</i>

111
00:18:21,141 --> 00:18:22,601
Who killed the music?

112
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:23,852
That's better.

113
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:28,899
Excuse us for interrupting. 
We're from the Rescue Aid Society.

114
00:18:29,483 --> 00:18:31,735
I am Miss Bianca, and this is my...

115
00:18:31,819 --> 00:18:34,238
The Miss Bianca? I don't believe it.

116
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:38,742
My brother, Orville, told me all about 
you. Boy. This is an honor to have...

117
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,162
<i>May</i> I <i>just say, "Enchant√©, sefiorita, "</i> 
to <i>you? May</i> I?

118
00:18:44,832 --> 00:18:47,084
We need to charter a flight.

119
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:50,879
You've come to the right place, 
buddy boy. Welcome to...

120
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,758
"Albatross Air. 
A fair fare from here to there."

121
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:58,679
Get it? A fair fare? 
It's a play on... Never mind.

122
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:01,849
I've got tons of exotic 
destinations, faraway places,

123
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:05,727
custom designed for 
a romantic weekend getaway.

124
00:19:06,395 --> 00:19:08,564
The finest in-flight accommodations.

125
00:19:08,856 --> 00:19:11,149
Speaking of which, what can I get you?

126
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:14,945
How about a nice mango Maui cooler? 
Very nice, very tasty.

127
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:16,196
No, thank you.

128
00:19:17,614 --> 00:19:20,200
A coconut, guava nectar? 
It's carbonated.

129
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,453
I got little umbrellas for each one, 
and a little coconut thing.

130
00:19:23,537 --> 00:19:27,040
- It's urgent that we leave immediately! 
- Nothing? Nothing at all?

131
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:30,586
- How about a cream soda? 
- We need a flight to Australia.

132
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:32,963
Australia? The land down under?

133
00:19:33,046 --> 00:19:36,592
That's a fabulous idea! 
So when can I pencil you in?

134
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:39,720
After spring thaw? 
Mid-June would be very nice.

135
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,805
We must leave tonight.

136
00:19:42,931 --> 00:19:44,641
Tonight?

137
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:48,103
Come on, you're kidding me, right?

138
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:51,315
Have you looked outside? 
It's suicide out there.

139
00:19:51,398 --> 00:19:54,151
No. No.

140
00:19:54,234 --> 00:19:57,279
I'm afraid yourjolly little holiday 
will have to wait.

141
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:58,739
What a bunch of jokers.

142
00:19:58,822 --> 00:20:02,576
But you don't understand, 
a boy needs our help. He's in trouble.

143
00:20:02,659 --> 00:20:05,871
Boy? You mean, a little kid kinda boy?

144
00:20:05,954 --> 00:20:07,206
He was kidnapped.

145
00:20:07,623 --> 00:20:11,084
Kidnapped? That's awful.

146
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:13,378
Locking up a little kid.

147
00:20:13,670 --> 00:20:15,005
A kid should be free.

148
00:20:15,255 --> 00:20:18,216
Free to run wild through the house 
on Saturday mornings.

149
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:22,137
Free to have cookies and milk, 
and get those little white mustaches.

150
00:20:22,262 --> 00:20:25,682
Nobody's gonna take 
a kid's freedom away while I'm around.

151
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:28,226
Does that mean you'll take us?

152
00:20:28,435 --> 00:20:33,607
Storm or no storm, 
Albatross Airlines, at your service!

153
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,110
Passengers are requested 
to fasten their seat belts

154
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:38,612
and secure all carry-ens.

155
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:43,075
We'll be departing following our 
pre-flight maintenance. Thank you.

156
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,912
Loosen up, get the blood flowing 
up to the head.

157
00:20:46,995 --> 00:20:49,289
And a couple of these...

158
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:52,251
Okay, one's enough, there we go.

159
00:20:55,003 --> 00:20:57,214
Yeah! That feels better. Baby.

160
00:20:57,506 --> 00:20:59,675
Tie your kangaroos down, sports fans!

161
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:02,344
Here we come!

162
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:07,391
Let's go for it! Hey! 
I didn't adjust for the winds.

163
00:21:07,474 --> 00:21:10,394
All right, we're gonna make it! 
Gotta duck down lower.

164
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:14,022
Go under the wind, go under it! 
Here we go!

165
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,984
This is cold!

166
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,279
Slippery! Ice!

167
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,738
We got ice!

168
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,991
Hang on now!

169
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:28,537
Here we go!

170
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:35,085
Cowabunga!

171
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:44,219
Captain, is this 
a non-stop flight to Australia?

172
00:21:44,303 --> 00:21:48,098
Well, not exactly no. 
I could definitely say no.

173
00:21:48,181 --> 00:21:51,018
We're gonna have to make 
connections with a bigger bird.

174
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:54,312
Non-stop? What do I look like, 
Charles Lindbergh?

175
00:21:59,401 --> 00:22:03,447
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Flight 12 
is now approaching Sydney airport.</i>

176
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:06,575
<i>Make sure your seat belts 
are fastened and tables secured.</i>

177
00:22:06,658 --> 00:22:08,869
<i>Enjoy your stay in Australia.</i>

178
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:15,333
- Are we there yet? 
- Yes.

179
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,502
Perhaps we should wake up Wilbur.

180
00:22:17,836 --> 00:22:20,005
All right, I'll get him up.

181
00:22:20,547 --> 00:22:22,215
Wilbur.

182
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:25,177
Wilbur!

183
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:27,471
Just five more minutes, Ma.

184
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,098
- Wilbur! 
- That's all I need, five more minutes.

185
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:33,351
Wilbur, are you awake?

186
00:22:33,435 --> 00:22:35,854
- Get up, we're there! 
- I'm up, I'm up.

187
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,356
Watch out!

188
00:22:38,774 --> 00:22:41,234
Must have been sleeping on a bolt.

189
00:22:43,236 --> 00:22:45,030
Oh, boy.

190
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:48,325
Throw another shrimp on the barbie, 
'cause here I come!

191
00:22:48,408 --> 00:22:52,496
- Here we go again! 
- Cannonball!

192
00:22:57,292 --> 00:23:00,337
Gangway! Coming through. 
Mice on board!

193
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:02,672
Clear the way! 
Move over madam, there you go!

194
00:23:02,756 --> 00:23:05,133
Coming through, sir. Thank you.

195
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:11,098
Next stop, Mugwomp Flats.

196
00:23:11,223 --> 00:23:14,017
Did we lose anyone back there?

197
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:17,854
Miss Bianca, from now on, 
can't we just take the train?

198
00:23:27,781 --> 00:23:31,910
Well, Sparky, 
you've had this coming for a long time.

199
00:23:32,410 --> 00:23:34,287
And now, you're gonna get it.

200
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,841
Wise fly.

201
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:48,802
<i>Mugwomp tower,</i>

202
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:53,473
<i>this is Albatross 1-3 
requesting permission to land. Over?</i>

203
00:23:53,598 --> 00:23:56,476
Albatross? Let's see.

204
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,520
Finch, wren, scrub-bird, lorikeet,

205
00:23:58,603 --> 00:24:00,564
freckled duck, galah, 
Kookaburra, parrot,

206
00:24:00,647 --> 00:24:03,650
cockatoo, alba... It's a jumbo!

207
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,986
Negative, you'll have to turn back.

208
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:09,322
- Our runway isn't long enough for you. 
- Not long enough?

209
00:24:09,406 --> 00:24:12,075
<i>Look pal, 
I can land this thing on a dime!</i>

210
00:24:12,159 --> 00:24:14,828
<i>Wilbur, 
if the runway isn't long enough...</i>

211
00:24:14,911 --> 00:24:18,081
<i>You can't let radar jockeys 
push you around. Leave it to me.</i>

212
00:24:19,082 --> 00:24:22,210
I say again, mate, 
our runway is too short.

213
00:24:22,294 --> 00:24:25,839
<i>And I say again, mate, I'm coming in!</i>

214
00:24:25,922 --> 00:24:29,342
Crazy Yank. Quick, Sparky, 
we gotta extend the runway.

215
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,765
Here we go!

216
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:37,309
We'll never make it!

217
00:24:41,396 --> 00:24:42,856
Hot!

218
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:45,275
Passengers, please remain seated

219
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:48,028
until the aircraft comes 
to a full and complete stop.

220
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,779
Thank you.

221
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:58,872
Quick, Sparky, 
we need to make a drag line!

222
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,929
Don't try and tell me 
the runway's too short.

223
00:25:14,137 --> 00:25:16,264
Hold this for me, will you, pal?

224
00:25:20,393 --> 00:25:22,229
Bloke ought to have his wings clipped.

225
00:25:22,312 --> 00:25:25,148
Captain thanks you 
for flying Albatross Airlines...

226
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,691
Crazy Yanks.

227
00:25:26,775 --> 00:25:29,945
They think they can do any fool thing 
without regard for...

228
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,624
Welcome to Australia, ma'am.

229
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:45,919
Name's Jake. If there's any way 
I can make your stay pleasant,

230
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,255
don't hesitate to ask.

231
00:25:48,338 --> 00:25:51,591
- How kind. 
- Allow me to get that bag for you.

232
00:25:52,676 --> 00:25:55,929
I've got a lot of luggage here.

233
00:25:56,054 --> 00:25:57,847
Let me give you a hand with those.

234
00:25:57,931 --> 00:26:00,141
Part of the friendly service 
at Albatross...

235
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:02,561
Big time hurt!

236
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,020
Back! It's out!

237
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:07,107
- Are you all right? 
- Don't worry, I'll handle this.

238
00:26:07,190 --> 00:26:10,527
Sparky, watch the tower. 
We gotta get this bird to the hospital.

239
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:14,114
Can't go down, can't go up. 
Take the bags!

240
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,491
Now we just gotta 
figure out how to get there.

241
00:26:16,574 --> 00:26:21,288
So are you and your husband here 
on a little outback excursion?

242
00:26:21,371 --> 00:26:23,373
No, we're not married.

243
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,795
In fact, we're here 
on a top secret mission.

244
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:30,505
Very hush-hush.

245
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:33,258
Gonna rescue that kid 
McLeach nabbed?

246
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:35,969
Why, that's right! How did you know?

247
00:26:36,052 --> 00:26:39,556
You'll find it's tough 
to keep secrets in the outback, miss.

248
00:26:39,848 --> 00:26:42,350
So which way you taking?

249
00:26:42,475 --> 00:26:45,937
Suicide Trail through Nightmare 
Canyon, or shortcut at Satan's Ridge?

250
00:26:46,021 --> 00:26:48,231
-"Suicide Trail"? 
- Good choice.

251
00:26:48,481 --> 00:26:50,817
More snakes, less quicksand.

252
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,030
Then once you cross Bloodworm Creek, 
you're scat-free, that is until...

253
00:26:55,447 --> 00:26:56,740
Dead Dingo Pass.

254
00:26:56,823 --> 00:27:01,244
Wait a minute, I don't see 
any of that stuff on the map.

255
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,288
A map's no good in the outback!

256
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:08,168
What you really need is someone 
who knows the territory.

257
00:27:08,251 --> 00:27:10,837
Mr. Jake, will you guide us?

258
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,839
At your service!

259
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:16,509
Better take my arm, miss. 
It's gonna be a treacherous hike.

260
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:20,680
I remember the time it was just me 
and 400 of these big, giant...

261
00:27:20,764 --> 00:27:23,767
Doesn't even know how to fold a map.

262
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:32,400
This is how we get around 
in the outback, Miss B.

263
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:35,737
The only way to travel, Berno.

264
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:39,366
Yeah, it's just a little bumpy back here.

265
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:49,459
Cinch up your seat belts, mates. 
We're coming in for a landing.

266
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:55,632
Hold it, not yet!

267
00:28:10,438 --> 00:28:11,606
Maybe I should go...

268
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:15,110
Maybe I should go look for him.

269
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,655
Don't you worry about Jake. 
He can handle himself.

270
00:28:19,155 --> 00:28:20,448
Yeah, I noticed.

271
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:23,201
I am just sure he'll be back in no time.

272
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:35,839
You know, 
now that we're alone, there's...

273
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:39,426
There's something that 
I've been wanting to ask you.

274
00:28:39,509 --> 00:28:41,469
Yes? What is it?

275
00:28:41,553 --> 00:28:44,639
Well, it's like this.

276
00:28:44,973 --> 00:28:49,561
Miss Bianca, I would be most honored

277
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,063
if...

278
00:28:52,188 --> 00:28:54,065
Look out!

279
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:01,197
No mice for you, Twister, not today!

280
00:29:01,322 --> 00:29:02,323
There!

281
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,118
Miss Bianca!

282
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,745
I've been looking all over for you.

283
00:29:07,829 --> 00:29:09,456
Now look.

284
00:29:09,831 --> 00:29:13,293
We got a long way to go, 
and you're gonna take us there.

285
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,045
You're not gonna give us 
any trouble about it.

286
00:29:16,796 --> 00:29:18,756
Right?

287
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,217
Jake's been gone...

288
00:29:20,842 --> 00:29:24,220
They're harmless once you look them 
in the eye, let them know who's boss.

289
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:24,721
Been gone a long time.

290
00:29:24,304 --> 00:29:27,098
Ain't that right, mate? Now get.

291
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:31,936
It's all right, Bernard. 
Jake has everything under control.

292
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:34,564
Yeah, I noticed.

293
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:40,695
You know, Miss Bianca, truth be told, 
I used to be quite a dingo wrestler.

294
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:44,032
There was this one time, 
it was just me and 300

295
00:29:44,157 --> 00:29:46,659
of these ferocious, 
mouse-eating dingoes.

296
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:49,037
Had me surrounded...

297
00:29:59,756 --> 00:30:01,633
Show him who's boss, Berno!

298
00:30:29,536 --> 00:30:31,538
Okay, you guys, she fell for it.

299
00:30:32,914 --> 00:30:34,624
Looks like the coast is clear.

300
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,710
Girls? Girls, I'm here!

301
00:30:39,546 --> 00:30:41,923
Where are you, you little chickees, you?

302
00:30:42,257 --> 00:30:43,591
Wilbur?

303
00:30:43,883 --> 00:30:45,260
Wilbur!

304
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:49,848
Don't ever do that to me again!

305
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,434
Boy, I lost a lot of feathers on that one.

306
00:30:53,518 --> 00:30:55,603
Wilbur, am I glad to see you!

307
00:30:55,770 --> 00:30:58,273
- Help me with these eggs, will you? 
- Sure.

308
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,609
Wait a minute, what the heck 
are you doing up here?

309
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:05,196
The kidnapper took the boy and Jake. 
Miss Bianca.

310
00:31:05,280 --> 00:31:06,864
Miss Bianca's in trouble?

311
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:13,037
That's terrible! We gotta do something! 
Bernard, I'm disappointed in you.

312
00:31:13,121 --> 00:31:15,039
Hiding under a nest 
while Bianca needs help.

313
00:31:15,415 --> 00:31:17,876
- I gotta talk to you, mister. 
- Wilbur.

314
00:31:17,959 --> 00:31:22,422
You should start searching the desert 
for her, and I'll scan the coastline!

315
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:25,008
That's what I'll do. 
Ask the chicks on the beach.

316
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:26,134
What?

317
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:29,262
Listen! There's some chicks 
here that need help.

318
00:31:29,345 --> 00:31:31,097
Really?

319
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:36,728
No. Wait a minute. Hold it.

320
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:40,148
I know what you're thinking, 
and you're wrong. Don't even, no.

321
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:43,693
Don't look at me! You're getting "no." 
Understand?

322
00:31:43,776 --> 00:31:45,903
I will not ever sit on those eggs!

323
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,489
Nuts!

324
00:31:50,366 --> 00:31:53,369
Gotta learn to be more assertive. 
No is no is no.

325
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,663
Hey, quit moving in there!

326
00:31:55,663 --> 00:31:55,705
Hey, quit moving in there!

327
00:32:11,638 --> 00:32:13,014
Oh, my gosh!

328
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:50,760
Excuse me.

329
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:56,766
Look, I've got a long way to go, 
you're going to take me there,

330
00:32:56,849 --> 00:32:59,519
and you're not going 
to give me any trouble, right?

331
00:33:03,189 --> 00:33:04,357
Good.

332
00:33:06,484 --> 00:33:07,860
NOW, get!

333
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:29,215
Help! Help!

334
00:34:00,705 --> 00:34:01,080
It's okay.

335
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:04,208
Come on.

336
00:34:06,419 --> 00:34:07,879
Thanks, little mate.

337
00:34:11,674 --> 00:34:17,555
Bernard, you are magnificent. 
You are absolutely the hero of the day.

338
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:21,058
Miss Bianca, 
before anything else happens,

339
00:34:23,186 --> 00:34:25,897
-will you marry me? 
- Bernard.

340
00:34:25,980 --> 00:34:28,483
Of course, I will!

341
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:31,402
Well done, mate.

342
00:34:31,778 --> 00:34:35,573
Come on, Marahute, let's all go home.

343
00:34:57,845 --> 00:34:58,930
Help!

344
00:34:59,013 --> 00:35:00,598
Anybody!

345
00:35:00,932 --> 00:35:02,558
Bernard!

346
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:04,894
Bianca!

347
00:35:04,977 --> 00:35:07,271
Where are you?

348
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,900
Okay, that's it, I'm out of here. 
This is ridiculous.

349
00:35:10,983 --> 00:35:13,319
You can't leave me here alone.

350
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:15,530
I'm gone! I am gone.

351
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,327
No, stay in those eggs! 
That's a direct order!

352
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,000
Hey, you're kind of a cute little feller.
