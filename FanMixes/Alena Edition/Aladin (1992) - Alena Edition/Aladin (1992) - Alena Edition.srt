1
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,880
<i>Oh, I come from a land 
From a faraway place</i>

2
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,080
<i>Where the caravan camels roam</i>

3
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:37,840
<i>Where it's flat and immense 
And the heat is intense</i>

4
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,280
<i>It's barbaric, but hey, it's home</i>

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,720
<i>When the wind's from the east 
And the sun's from the west</i>

6
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,800
<i>And the sand in the glass is right</i>

7
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,160
<i>Come on down, stop on by 
Hop a carpet and fly</i>

8
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,240
<i>To another Arabian night</i>

9
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,920
<i>Arabian nights</i>

10
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,480
<i>Like Arabian days</i>

11
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,200
<i>More often than not 
Are hotter than hot</i>

12
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,760
<i>In a lot of good ways</i>

13
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:14,120
<i>Arabian nights</i>

14
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:17,800
<i>'Neath Arabian moons</i>

15
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:21,760
<i>A fool off his guard 
Could fall and fall hard</i>

16
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:26,560
<i>Out there on the dunes</i>

17
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,360
Ah, salaam and good evening 
to you, worthy friend.

18
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:35,640
Please, please, come closer.

19
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:38,040
Too close. A little too close.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,680
There.

21
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,000
Welcome to Agrabah,

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,120
city of mystery, of enchantment,

23
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,160
and the finest merchandise 
this side of the River Jordan,

24
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:50,120
on sale today. Come on down.

25
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:51,800
Look at this. Yes.

26
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:55,600
Combination hookah and coffeemaker. 
Also makes julienne fries.

27
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,880
Will not break. Will not...

28
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,400
It broke.

29
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:02,040
Ohh! Look at this.

30
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:04,880
I have never seen one 
of these intact before.

31
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,800
This is the famous 
Dead Sea Tupperware.

32
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:10,400
Listen. Ah, still good.

33
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,840
Wait. Don't go.

34
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:15,680
I can see that you're only interested 
in the exceptionally rare.

35
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,080
I think, then, you would be 
most rewarded to consider this.

36
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,520
Do not be fooled by its 
commonplace appearance.

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,160
Like so many things, it 
is not what is outside,

38
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,880
but what is inside that counts.

39
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:30,680
This is no ordinary lamp.

40
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,480
It once changed the course 
of a young man's life.

41
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:37,600
A young man who, like this lamp, 
was more than what he seemed.

42
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,400
A diamond in the rough.

43
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,600
Stop! Thief!

44
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:41,720
Stop! Thief!

45
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:45,240
I'll have your hands for 
a trophy, street rat.

46
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:47,760
All this for a loaf of bread?

47
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,640
Whoa!

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,120
- There he is! 
- You won't get away so easy!

49
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:04,080
You think that was easy?

50
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,200
You two, over that way, 
and you, follow me.

51
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,440
- We'll find him. 
- Morning, ladies.

52
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,240
Getting into trouble a little 
early today, aren't we, Aladdin?

53
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:17,480
Trouble? No way. You're only 
in trouble if you get caught.

54
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,160
- Gotcha. 
- I'm in trouble.

55
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,560
And this time...

56
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,200
Perfect timing, Abu, as usual.

57
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,920
- Abu. 
- Come on. Let's get outta here.

58
00:03:26,920 --> 00:03:29,600
<i>Gotta keep one jump 
Ahead of the bread line</i>

59
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,440
<i>One swing ahead of the sword</i>

60
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,880
<i>I steal only what I can't afford</i>

61
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,240
<i>That's everything</i>

62
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,160
<i>One jump ahead of the lawmen</i>

63
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,040
<i>That's all, and that's no joke</i>

64
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:42,280
<i>These guys don't 
appreciate I'm broke</i>

65
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,360
<i>- Riffraff 
Street rat</i>

66
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,240
<i>Scoundrel 
Take that</i>

67
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,120
<i>Just a little snack, guys</i>

68
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:53,960
<i>Rip him open 
Take it back, guys</i>

69
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,720
<i>I can take a hint 
Gotta face the facts</i>

70
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:57,800
<i>- You're my only friend, Abu 
Who?</i>

71
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:01,480
<i>Oh, it's sad Aladdin's 
hit the bottom</i>

72
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:05,160
<i>He's become a one-man rise in crime</i>

73
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,880
<i>I'd blame parents 
Except he hasn't got 'em</i>

74
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,600
<i>Gotta eat to live 
Gotta steal to eat</i>

75
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,840
<i>Tell you all about it 
When I got the time</i>

76
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:16,519
<i>One jump ahead of the slowpokes 
One skip ahead of my doom</i>

77
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:18,800
<i>Next time gonna use a nom de plume</i>

78
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:20,360
<i>There he is</i>

79
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:24,160
<i>One jump ahead of the hit men 
One hit ahead of the flock</i>

80
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,400
<i>I think I'll take a stroll 
Around the block</i>

81
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
<i>- Stop, thief 
- Vandal</i>

82
00:04:29,560 --> 00:04:31,320
<i>- Abu 
- Scandal</i>

83
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:35,440
<i>Let's not be too hasty</i>

84
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,240
<i>Still I think he's rather tasty</i>

85
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,120
<i>Gotta eat to live 
Gotta steal to eat</i>

86
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,560
<i>Otherwise we'd get along</i>

87
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,520
Wrong

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:46,760
Get him!

89
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,920
He's got a sword!

90
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,680
You idiots. We've all got swords.

91
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,960
<i>- One jump ahead of the hoof beats 
- Vandal!</i>

92
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:08,720
<i>- One hop ahead of the hump 
- Street rat!</i>

93
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,600
<i>- One trick ahead of disaster 
- Scoundrel!</i>

94
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,440
<i>They're quick, but I'm much faster</i>

95
00:05:12,440 --> 00:05:13,120
<i>Here goes, better throw my hand in</i>

96
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,800
<i>Wish me happy landin' 
All I gotta do is jump</i>

97
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:26,120
Yuck! Oy!

98
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,960
And now, esteemed effendi, 
we feast. All right.

99
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,880
Yum, yum!

100
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:45,560
Uh-oh.

101
00:05:57,920 --> 00:06:01,280
Here. Go on. Take it.

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,760
Ah, don't. Huh?

103
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,800
I've never been so insulted.

104
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,760
Oh, Prince Achmed. You're not 
leaving so soon, are you?

105
00:06:28,760 --> 00:06:31,040
Good luck marrying her off.

106
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,840
Oh! Jasmine.

107
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,640
Jasmine!

108
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,920
Jasmine!

109
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:43,320
Confound it, Rajah.

110
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,880
So, this is why Prince 
Achmed stormed out.

111
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,480
Oh, Father.

112
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:53,200
Rajah was just playing with 
him. Weren't you, Rajah?

113
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,360
You were just playing 
with that overdressed,

114
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:58,040
self-absorbed Prince 
Achmed, weren't you?

115
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,320
Dearest, you've got to stop rejecting 
every suitor who comes to call.

116
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:09,840
The law says you must 
be married to a prince

117
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,920
by your next birthday.

118
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,400
The law is wrong.

119
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,760
You've only got three more days.

120
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:19,240
Father, I hate being 
forced into this.

121
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,640
If I do marry, I want 
it to be for love.

122
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,280
Jasmine,

123
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:27,920
it's not only this law.

124
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:33,520
I'm not going to be around 
forever, and, well, I...

125
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,920
I just want to make sure 
you're taken care of.

126
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,360
Provided for.

127
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,520
Please try to understand.

128
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:46,000
I've never done a thing on my own. 
I've never had any real friends.

129
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,080
Except you, Rajah.

130
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,920
I've never even been 
outside the palace walls.

131
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:55,560
But, Jasmine, you're a princess.

132
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:58,320
Then maybe I don't want to 
be a princess any more.

133
00:07:58,320 --> 00:08:01,160
Oooh! I... I...

134
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:04,360
Allah forbid you should 
have any daughters.

135
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,160
Hmm?

136
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:19,760
I don't know where 
she gets it from.

137
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,040
Her mother wasn't nearly so picky.

138
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,240
Oh! Ah, Jafar.

139
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,960
My most trusted advisor.

140
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,720
I am in desperate 
need of your wisdom.

141
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:34,640
My life is but to 
serve you, my lord.

142
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,799
It's this suitor business. Jasmine 
refuses to choose a husband.

143
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:42,120
- I'm at my wit's end. 
- Awk! Wit's end!

144
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,240
Oh!

145
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,920
Have a cracker, pretty Polly.

146
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,440
Your Majesty certainly has 
a way with dumb animals.

147
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:56,920
Now, then, perhaps I 
can divine a solution

148
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,880
to this thorny problem.

149
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:00,640
If anyone can help, it's you.

150
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,360
But it would require the use 
of the mystic blue diamond.

151
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,440
Oh. Uh, my ring?

152
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,720
But it's been in the 
family for years.

153
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,000
It is necessary to find 
the princess a suitor.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Don't worry.

155
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:21,880
Everything will be fine.

156
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,000
The diamond.

157
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,320
Here, Jafar.

158
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,840
Whatever you need will be fine.

159
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:32,360
You are most gracious, my liege.

160
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:36,080
Now, run along and play 
with your little toys, hmm?

161
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,240
Yes. That will be pretty good.

162
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,600
I can't take it any more!

163
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:50,480
If I gotta choke down on one more of 
those mouldy, disgusting crackers...

164
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,640
Bam! Whack!

165
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,320
Calm yourself, Iago.

166
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:55,760
Then I'd grab him around 
the head. Whack!

167
00:09:55,760 --> 00:09:59,960
Soon I will be sultan, not 
that addlepated twit.

168
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:05,360
And then I stuff the crackers 
down his throat. Ha, ha!

169
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,040
Oh, I'm sorry, Rajah.

170
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,160
But I can't stay here and 
have my life lived for me.

171
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,920
I'll miss you.

172
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:42,760
Good bye.

173
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,400
Okay, Abu. Go.

174
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,280
Try this. Your taste buds 
will dance and sing.

175
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:03,880
Get your paws off that.

176
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,200
Why, you...

177
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:09,160
Get away from here, 
you cursed, filthy ape!

178
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:12,080
Good bye.

179
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,880
Nice going, Abu.

180
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,880
Breakfast is served.

181
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,960
Pretty lady, buy a pot. No 
finer pot in brass or silver.

182
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:27,400
Sugar dates. Sugar dates and figs.

183
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,680
Sugar dates and pistachios.

184
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,440
Would the lady like a necklace?

185
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,680
A pretty necklace 
for a pretty lady.

186
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,200
Fresh fish!

187
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,560
We catch 'em, you buy 'em!

188
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,640
Oh, no. I don't think so.

189
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,360
Oh!

190
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:42,640
Excuse me.

191
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:49,920
I'm really very sorry.

192
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:51,840
Wow.

193
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,360
Uh-oh.

194
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:00,440
Hello? Hello?

195
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:00,880
Hello? Hello?

196
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:08,800
O wise Sultan, how may I serve you?

197
00:12:12,280 --> 00:12:14,160
Tragic, isn't it?

198
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:16,360
But no harm done.

199
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:18,960
Now, come along, sis. 
Time to go see the doctor.

200
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,240
Oh, hello, Doctor. How are you?

201
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:24,840
No, no, no. Not that one. 
Come on, Sultan.

202
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,920
Huh? What?

203
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:32,600
Come back here, you little thieves!

204
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:39,320
With all due respect, 
Your Rottenness,

205
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,520
couldn't we just wait 
for a real storm?

206
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:45,200
Save your breath, Iago. Faster.

207
00:12:45,640 --> 00:12:48,240
Yes, O mighty evil one.

208
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,760
Part, sands of time.

209
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,600
Reveal to me the one who 
can enter the cave.

210
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,080
Yes! Yes!

211
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:03,480
There he is.

212
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,760
My diamond in the rough.

213
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:09,520
That's him? That's the clown 
we've been waitin' for?

214
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:15,800
Let's have the guards extend him an 
invitation to the palace, shall we?

215
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:17,560
Swell.

216
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:23,920
Almost there.

217
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:33,880
I want to thank you for 
stopping that man.

218
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:36,120
Uh, forget it.

219
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:40,240
So, this is your first time 
in the marketplace, huh?

220
00:13:42,400 --> 00:13:44,200
Is it that obvious?

221
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:47,160
Well, you do kind of stand out.

222
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:52,440
I mean, uh, you don't seem to know 
how dangerous Agrabah can be.

223
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:55,640
Hmm. I'm a fast learner.

224
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,480
Wow.

225
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,440
Hey.

226
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,320
Come on. This way.

227
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:06,080
Whoa. Watch your head there.

228
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,560
Be careful.

229
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Is this where you live?

230
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:12,920
Yep. Just me and Abu. 
Come and go as we please.

231
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,680
That sounds fabulous.

232
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:19,120
Well, it's not much, but 
it's got a great view.

233
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,440
Wow. The palace looks 
pretty amazing, huh?

234
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:25,400
Oh, it's wonderful.

235
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,680
I wonder what it would 
be like to live there,

236
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,320
and have servants and valets.

237
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,960
Oh, sure. People who tell you 
where to go and how to dress.

238
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,160
It's better than here.

239
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,680
You're always scraping for 
food and ducking the guards.

240
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,920
You're not free to 
make your own choices.

241
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,280
- Sometimes you feel so... 
- You're just...

242
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:45,320
- Trapped. 
- Trapped.

243
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:52,480
So, where are you from?

244
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,320
What does it matter?

245
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:57,240
I ran away and I am not going back.

246
00:14:57,720 --> 00:15:01,240
- Really? How come? 
- Why, you...

247
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:05,400
My father's forcing 
me to get married.

248
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,600
That's... That's awful.

249
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:12,520
Abu!

250
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,360
What?

251
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,040
Abu says, uh, that's not fair.

252
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,160
What?

253
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,880
- Oh, did he? 
- Yeah, of course.

254
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:25,840
And does Abu have 
anything else to say?

255
00:15:25,840 --> 00:15:28,920
Well, uh, he wishes there was 
something he could do to help.

256
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:30,880
Oh, boy.

257
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,640
Hmm.

258
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,120
Tell him that's very sweet.

259
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,640
Here you are.

260
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,800
- They're after me! 
- They're after you?

261
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,160
My father must have sent them...

262
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,360
- Do you trust me? 
- What?

263
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,920
- Do you trust me? 
- Yes...

264
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,760
Then jump!

265
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,240
We just keep running into each 
other, don't we, street rat?

266
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:01,160
Run! Go! Get out of here!

267
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:03,360
Get this thing off of me!

268
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,680
- It's the dungeon for you, boy. 
- Get off of me.

269
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:07,800
Let him go.

270
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:12,080
Looky here, men. A street mouse.

271
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:16,240
Unhand him, by order 
of the princess.

272
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:18,840
Princess Jasmine.

273
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,480
- The princess? 
- Princess?

274
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:23,640
What are you doing outside the 
palace? And with this street rat.

275
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:27,600
That's not your concern. Do as 
I command. Release him.

276
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:31,280
I would, Princess, except 
my orders come from Jafar.

277
00:16:31,280 --> 00:16:35,320
- You'll have to take it up with him. 
- Believe me, I will.

278
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,800
Jafar?

279
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,720
Oh, Princess.

280
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,120
Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

281
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,320
How may I be of service to you?

282
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:52,720
The guards just took a boy from 
the market, on your orders.

283
00:16:53,080 --> 00:16:56,440
Your father has charged me 
with keeping peace in Agrabah.

284
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:59,280
- The boy was a criminal. 
- What was his crime?

285
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,560
I can't breathe, Jafar.

286
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,079
Why, kidnapping the 
princess, of course.

287
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:06,319
If you could just... 
Aah! That hurt!

288
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,880
He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

289
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,359
Oh, dear.

290
00:17:12,119 --> 00:17:16,079
Oh, how frightfully upsetting. 
Had I but known...

291
00:17:16,359 --> 00:17:17,520
What do you mean?

292
00:17:17,520 --> 00:17:21,079
Sadly, the boy's sentence has 
already been carried out.

293
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:22,680
What sentence?

294
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:24,240
Death.

295
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,240
- By beheading. 
- No.

296
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:33,320
I am exceedingly sorry, Princess.

297
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,480
How could you?

298
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,080
So, how did it go?

299
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:51,040
I think she took it rather well.

300
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:06,480
It's all my fault, Rajah.

301
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:11,640
I didn't even know his name.

302
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:33,160
She was the princess. 
I can't believe it.

303
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,960
I must have sounded 
so stupid to her.

304
00:18:35,960 --> 00:18:39,920
Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Hello!

305
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:42,600
Abu. Down here.

306
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:46,200
Come on, help me out of these.

307
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:56,920
Hey, she was in trouble. 
Ah, she was worth it.

308
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:58,320
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

309
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,960
Don't worry, Abu. 
I'll never see her again.

310
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:03,960
I'm a street rat, remember? 
And there's a law.

311
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,360
She's gotta marry a prince.

312
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,720
- She deserves a prince. 
- Ta-da!

313
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:12,560
I'm a fool.

314
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:16,440
You're only a fool 
if you give up, boy.

315
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,080
Who are you?

316
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:20,840
A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

317
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:24,280
But together, perhaps 
we can be more.

318
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,720
I'm listening.

319
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:29,920
There is a cave, boy, 
a Cave of Wonders,

320
00:19:29,920 --> 00:19:34,080
filled with treasures 
beyond your wildest dreams.

321
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:35,320
Ooh!

322
00:19:35,320 --> 00:19:39,720
Treasure enough to impress 
even your princess, I'd wager.

323
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,360
Jafar, can you hurry up? 
I'm dyin' in here.

324
00:19:42,360 --> 00:19:44,880
But the law says 
only a prince can...

325
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,600
You've heard of the 
golden rule, haven't you?

326
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,160
Whoever has the gold 
makes the rules.

327
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:54,360
Why would you share all of this 
wonderful treasure with me?

328
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:58,080
I need a young pair of legs and a 
strong back to go in after it.

329
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,760
Uh, one problem.

330
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:02,880
It's out there. We're in here.

331
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:08,240
Uh-uh. Things aren't 
always what they seem.

332
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,800
So, do we have a deal?

333
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,760
Oh, I don't know.

334
00:20:25,560 --> 00:20:29,640
Who disturbs my slumber?

335
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,080
Uh, it is I, Aladdin.

336
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,520
Proceed.

337
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:41,200
Touch nothing but the lamp.

338
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:44,560
Remember, boy, first 
fetch me the lamp,

339
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:48,360
and then you shall 
have your reward.

340
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:50,520
Come on, Abu.

341
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,600
Would you look at that!

342
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:12,840
Just a handful of this stuff would 
make me richer than the sultan.

343
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,920
Abu!

344
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:18,680
Don't touch anything.

345
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,320
We gotta find that lamp.

346
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,000
Huh?

347
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:53,560
- Aladdin! 
- Abu, will you knock it off?

348
00:22:15,800 --> 00:22:18,480
Abu, what are you, crazy?

349
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:23,400
A magic carpet.

350
00:22:23,480 --> 00:22:27,080
Come on. Come on out. 
We're not gonna hurt you.

351
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:39,080
Hey, take it easy, Abu. 
He's not gonna bite.

352
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:40,240
Thanks.

353
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:50,240
Wait a minute. Don't go.

354
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,560
Maybe you can help us.

355
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,400
Hey! Whoa!

356
00:22:56,760 --> 00:22:59,000
You see, we're trying 
to find this lamp.

357
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,960
I think he knows where it is.

358
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:20,240
Wait here.

359
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,560
Oh!

360
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,680
This is it?

361
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:57,560
This is what we came all 
the way down here to...

362
00:23:57,680 --> 00:24:00,120
Abu! No!

363
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:03,080
- Infidels! 
- Uh-oh.

364
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:08,240
You have touched the 
forbidden treasure!

365
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:14,680
Now you will never again 
see the light of day!

366
00:24:15,480 --> 00:24:17,080
Whoa!

367
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:43,240
Help! Help! Help!

368
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:46,560
Gotcha!

369
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,640
Carpet, let's move.

370
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,640
Abu!

371
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:10,360
Abu, this is no time to panic.

372
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,680
Start panicking.

373
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,000
Whoa!

374
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:42,440
- Help me out. 
- Throw me the lamp.

375
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:05,080
It's mine.

376
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,320
It's all mine.

377
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,040
I... Where is it?

378
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,600
No.

379
00:26:11,600 --> 00:26:14,480
No!

380
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:20,600
Jasmine?

381
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,600
Oh, dearest.

382
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,400
What's wrong?

383
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,320
Jafar has

384
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:32,840
done something terrible.

385
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:35,520
There, there, my dear.

386
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:37,640
We'll set it right.

387
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:40,640
Now, tell me everything.

388
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,440
Oh.

389
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,000
Aladdin. Wake up.

390
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,720
Aladdin.

391
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:51,960
Oh! My head.

392
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,880
We're trapped.

393
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:59,000
That two-faced son of a jackal!

394
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:04,400
Whoever he was, he's long 
gone with that lamp.

395
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,760
Aha!

396
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:09,440
Why, you hairy little thief.

397
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,920
Looks like such a beat-up, 
worthless piece of junk.

398
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,280
Hey, I think there's 
something written here,

399
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:18,480
but it's hard to make out.

400
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:32,360
Aah!

401
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,920
Oy!

402
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:39,080
10,000 years will give you 
such a crick in the neck.

403
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,760
Hang on a second.

404
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:43,160
Whoa! Whoa!

405
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:45,560
Does it feel good 
to be outta there.

406
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,680
I'm telling you, nice to be 
back, ladies and gentlemen.

407
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,600
Hi. Where you from? 
What's your name?

408
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:51,200
Uh... Uh, Aladdin.

409
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,120
Aladdin. Hello, Aladdin. 
Nice to have you on the show.

410
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,160
Can we call you Al? 
Or maybe just Din?

411
00:27:56,160 --> 00:28:00,640
How about Laddie? Sounds like, 
"Here, boy. C'mon, laddie."

412
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,400
I must have hit my head 
harder than I thought.

413
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:06,200
Do you smoke? Mind if I do?

414
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,800
Oh, sorry, Cheeta. Hope 
I didn't singe the fur.

415
00:28:08,800 --> 00:28:11,360
Yo, Rugman. Haven't seen 
you in a few millennia.

416
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,840
Give me some tassel. Yeah. Yo, yo.

417
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:18,520
Say, you're a lot smaller 
than my last master.

418
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:19,840
Either that or I'm gettin' bigger.

419
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:21,960
Look at me from the side. 
Do I look different to you?

420
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:24,840
Wait a minute. I'm your master?

421
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,880
That's right. He can be taught. 
What would you wish of me?

422
00:28:27,880 --> 00:28:30,040
The ever impressive,

423
00:28:30,040 --> 00:28:33,200
the long contained,

424
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:34,240
the often imitated,

425
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,280
but never duplicated...

426
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:38,360
Duplicated, duplicated...

427
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:42,080
Genie of the Lamp!

428
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,840
Right here direct from the lamp,

429
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,400
right here for your very 
much wish fulfillment.

430
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:47,760
Thank you.

431
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:50,880
- Whoa. Wish fulfillment? 
- Three wishes, to be exact.

432
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:53,720
And ixnay on the wishing 
for more wishes.

433
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,360
That's it. Three. <i>Uno, dos, tres.</i>

434
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,680
No substitutions, 
exchanges or refunds.

435
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:00,160
Now I know I'm dreaming.

436
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:03,720
Master, I don't think you quite 
realise what you've got here.

437
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:09,200
So why don't you just ruminate whilst 
I illuminate the possibilities.

438
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,600
<i>Well, Ali Baba had them 40 thieves</i>

439
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,720
<i>Scheherazade had a thousand tales</i>

440
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:17,080
<i>But, master, you're in luck 
'Cause up your sleeves</i>

441
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,320
<i>You got a brand of 
magic never fails</i>

442
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,800
<i>You got some power 
In your corner now</i>

443
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:24,040
<i>Some heavy ammunition in your camp</i>

444
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:26,440
<i>You got some punch, pizzazz 
Yahoo and how</i>

445
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,520
<i>See, all you gotta do 
Is rub that lamp and I'll say</i>

446
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:33,520
<i>"Mr Aladdin, sir 
What will your pleasure be?"</i>

447
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,880
<i>Let me take your order 
Jot it down</i>

448
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,200
<i>You ain't never had 
a friend like me</i>

449
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:42,920
<i>Life is your restaurant 
And I'm your maitre d'</i>

450
00:29:42,920 --> 00:29:45,280
<i>Come on, whisper 
what it is you want</i>

451
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:47,320
<i>You ain't never had 
a friend like me</i>

452
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,960
<i>Yes, sir 
We pride ourselves on service</i>

453
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:52,480
<i>You're the boss, the king, the shah</i>

454
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:54,840
<i>Say what you wish 
It's yours, true dish</i>

455
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:57,840
<i>How 'bout a little more baklava?</i>

456
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:01,120
<i>Have some of column A 
Try all of column B</i>

457
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,280
<i>I'm in the mood to help you, dude</i>

458
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,120
<i>You ain't never had 
a friend like me</i>

459
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:10,400
<i>Oh, my</i>

460
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,720
<i>No, no</i>

461
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,040
<i>My, my</i>

462
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,760
<i>Can your friends do this?</i>

463
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,120
<i>Can your friends do that?</i>

464
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:22,480
<i>Can your friends pull this</i>

465
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:24,920
<i>Out their little hat?</i>

466
00:30:24,920 --> 00:30:27,160
<i>Can your friends go poof</i>

467
00:30:27,160 --> 00:30:29,600
<i>Hey, looky here 
Ha-ha!</i>

468
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,720
<i>Can your friends go 
"Abracadabra, let her rip"</i>

469
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,920
<i>And then make the sucker disappear?</i>

470
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,400
<i>So don't you sit there 
Slack-jawed, buggy-eyed</i>

471
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,440
<i>I'm here to answer 
All your midnight prayers</i>

472
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:42,120
<i>You got me bona fide certified</i>

473
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:44,120
<i>You got a genie 
For your charge d'affaires</i>

474
00:30:44,120 --> 00:30:46,360
<i>I got a powerful 
urge to help you out</i>

475
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,600
<i>So what's your wish? 
I really wanna know</i>

476
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,840
<i>You got a list 
That's three miles long, no doubt</i>

477
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:53,760
<i>All you gotta do is rub like so</i>

478
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:57,800
<i>Mr Aladdin, sir 
Have a wish or two or three</i>

479
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,240
<i>I'm on the job, you big nabob</i>

480
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:04,760
<i>You ain't never had a friend 
Never had a friend</i>

481
00:31:04,760 --> 00:31:08,880
<i>You ain't never had a friend</i>

482
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:12,200
<i>Like me</i>

483
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:13,840
Ah-ha-ha!

484
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,600
Wah-ha-ha!

485
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:19,320
<i>You ain't never had 
a friend like me</i>

486
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:24,360
Huh?

487
00:31:24,360 --> 00:31:26,800
So, what'll it be, master?

488
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:30,560
You're gonna grant me any 
three wishes I want, right?

489
00:31:30,560 --> 00:31:31,800
Ah, almost.

490
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:34,840
There are a few provisos, 
a couple of quid pro quos.

491
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,120
Like?

492
00:31:36,120 --> 00:31:39,120
Ah, rule number one, 
I can't kill anybody.

493
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:40,480
So don't ask.

494
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:41,760
Rule number two.

495
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:45,720
I can't make anybody fall 
in love with anybody else.

496
00:31:45,800 --> 00:31:47,800
You little <i>ponem</i> there.

497
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:52,280
Rule number three. I can't bring 
people back from the dead.

498
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:55,480
It's not a pretty picture. 
I don't like doing it.

499
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,720
Other than that, you got it.

500
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,560
- Hmm. 
- Oh!

501
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:04,280
Provisos? You mean limitations?

502
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,720
On wishes? Some all-powerful genie.

503
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,080
Can't even bring people 
back from the dead.

504
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:13,440
I don't know, Abu. He probably 
can't even get us out of this cave.

505
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,960
Looks like we're gonna have 
to find a way out of here.

506
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:17,760
Excuse me?

507
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,520
Are you lookin' at me? 
Did you rub my lamp?

508
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,480
Did you wake me up? 
Did you bring me here?

509
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,480
And all of sudden you're 
walking out on me?

510
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:28,280
I don't think so, not right now.

511
00:32:28,280 --> 00:32:30,680
You're gettin' your 
wishes, so sit down!

512
00:32:30,680 --> 00:32:32,920
In case of emergency,

513
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:35,400
the exits are here, here, 
here, here, anywhere.

514
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:37,720
Keep your hands and 
arms inside the carpet.

515
00:32:37,720 --> 00:32:39,120
We're...

516
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:43,400
Outta here!

517
00:32:44,360 --> 00:32:46,120
Jafar, this is an outrage.

518
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:49,760
If it weren't for all your 
years of loyal service...

519
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,040
From now on, you are to discuss 
sentencing of prisoners with me,

520
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,520
before they are beheaded.

521
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:59,440
I assure you, Your Highness, 
it won't happen again.

522
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,880
Jasmine...

523
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:05,520
Jafar. Let's put this whole 
messy business behind us.

524
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,680
Please.

525
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:11,120
My most abject and humblest 
apologies to you as well, Princess.

526
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,160
At least some good will come 
of my being forced to marry.

527
00:33:14,160 --> 00:33:18,120
When I am queen, I will have 
the power to get rid of you.

528
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,120
There, now. That's nice. 
All settled, then.

529
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:26,440
Now, Jasmine, getting back to 
this suitor business... Jasmine?

530
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:28,360
Jasmine!

531
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,120
If only I had gotten that lamp.

532
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:36,160
"I will have the power 
to get rid of you."

533
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:39,560
To think we gotta keep kissing up

534
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:43,160
to that chump and 
his chump daughter

535
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:45,640
- for the rest of our lives... 
- No, Iago.

536
00:33:45,640 --> 00:33:49,560
Only until she finds 
a chump husband.

537
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,600
Then she'll have us banished.

538
00:33:52,000 --> 00:33:53,800
Or beheaded.

539
00:33:53,800 --> 00:33:55,720
Eww!

540
00:33:56,680 --> 00:33:58,600
Oh. Wait a minute. Jafar.

541
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:01,400
What if you were the chump husband?

542
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,640
What?

543
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:05,880
Okay, you marry the 
princess, all right?

544
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:09,280
And, uh, then you 
become the sultan.

545
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,760
Oh.

546
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,560
Marry the shrew.

547
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,360
I become the sultan.

548
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,159
- The idea has merit. 
- Yes, merit. Yes.

549
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:25,560
And then we drop papa-in-law and 
the little woman off a cliff.

550
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,480
Yaaah!

551
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:29,320
Kersplat!

552
00:34:30,679 --> 00:34:34,320
I love the way your 
foul little mind works.

553
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:46,520
Thank you for choosing Magic 
Carpet for all your travel needs.

554
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:50,040
Don't stand until the rug 
has come to a complete stop.

555
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:53,120
Thank you. Goodbye now. 
Good-bye. Thank you.

556
00:34:53,120 --> 00:34:57,400
Well, how about that, 
Mr Doubting Mustafa?

557
00:34:57,400 --> 00:35:02,040
Oh, you sure showed me. 
Now, about my three wishes.

558
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:04,080
Dost mine ears deceive me?

559
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:07,120
Three? You are down by one, boy.

560
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:10,840
Ah, no. I never actually 
wished to get out of the cave.

561
00:35:10,840 --> 00:35:13,000
You did that on your own.

562
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:16,760
Well, I feel sheepish.

563
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,920
All right, you bad boy, 
but no more freebies.

564
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:23,000
Fair deal. So, three wishes.

565
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:25,120
I want them to be good.

566
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,840
What would you wish for?

567
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,640
Me?

568
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:31,000
No one's ever asked me that before.

569
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,240
Well, in my case... Ah, forget it.

570
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,800
- What? 
- No, I can't. I...

571
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:38,200
Come on. Tell me.

572
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,040
Freedom.

573
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,120
You're a prisoner?

574
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:43,480
It's all part and parcel 
of the whole genie gig.

575
00:35:43,480 --> 00:35:47,080
Phenomenal cosmic powers...

576
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,520
Itty bitty living space.

577
00:35:48,520 --> 00:35:50,680
Genie, that's terrible.

578
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:53,720
But, oh, to be free...

579
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:55,600
Not have to go, "Poof. 
What do you need?

580
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:58,040
"Poof. What do you need? 
Poof. What do you need?"

581
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,960
To be my own master.

582
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:02,800
Such a thing would be 
greater than all the magic

583
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:06,040
and all the treasures 
in all the world.

584
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,360
But what am I talking about?

585
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:09,720
Let's get real here. 
It's not gonna happen.

586
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:12,120
Genie, wake up and 
smell the hummus.

587
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,360
Why not?

588
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:17,240
The only way I get outta this 
is if my master wishes me out.

589
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,680
So you can guess how 
often that's happened.

590
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:21,280
I'll do it. I'll set you free.

591
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:25,440
- Uh-huh, yeah, right. 
- No, really, I promise.

592
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,040
After I make my first two wishes,

593
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:29,720
I'll use my third 
wish to set you free.

594
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:32,520
Well, here's hopin'. All right.

595
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,640
Let's make some magic.

596
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:37,720
So how 'bout it? What 
is it you want most?

597
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:41,320
Well, there's this girl.

598
00:36:41,320 --> 00:36:42,400
Wrong.

599
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,120
I can't make anybody 
fall in love, remember?

600
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,400
Oh, but, Genie, she's 
smart and fun and...

601
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,360
- Pretty? 
- Beautiful.

602
00:36:51,360 --> 00:36:54,520
She's got these eyes that 
just... And this hair. Wow.

603
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,040
And her smile...

604
00:36:57,040 --> 00:36:58,640
<i>Ami.</i>

605
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,440
<i>C'est l'amour.</i>

606
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,480
But she's the princess.

607
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:04,840
To even have a chance, 
I'd have to be...

608
00:37:04,840 --> 00:37:07,680
Hey, can you make me a prince?

609
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,040
Let's see here.

610
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:11,760
Chicken à la king? Nope.

611
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:14,880
Alaskan king crab. Ow. 
I hate it when they do that.

612
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,320
Caesar salad. Ah! <i>Et tu, Brute?</i> No.

613
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:20,560
Aha. "To make a prince."

614
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:22,920
Is that an official wish? 
Say the magic words.

615
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,720
Genie, I wish for you 
to make me a prince.

616
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,160
All right!

617
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:28,440
Yo, yo! Woof! Woof!

618
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:32,400
First, that fez-and-vest combo 
is much too third century.

619
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,360
These patches. What are 
we trying to say, beggar?

620
00:37:34,360 --> 00:37:36,960
No. Let's work with me here.

621
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,800
Ooh. I like it. <i>Muy macho.</i>

622
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,840
Now, it still needs something. 
What does it say to me?

623
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:45,560
It says mode of transportation.

624
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:48,400
Excuse me, monkey boy. 
<i>Aquí.</i> Over here.

625
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,600
- Uh-oh. 
- Here he comes.

626
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:53,440
What better way to make your 
entrance on the streets of Agrabah

627
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:56,960
than riding your very 
own, brand-new camel?

628
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:58,240
Watch out. They spit.

629
00:37:58,240 --> 00:38:00,680
Mmm. Not enough.

630
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:05,240
Still not enough. Let's see. 
What do you need?

631
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,280
Yes!

632
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:10,200
Esalalumbo shimin Dumbo.

633
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,800
Whoa!

634
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,800
Talk about your trunk space. 
Check this action out.

635
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:23,520
Abu, you look good.

636
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,720
He's got the outfit. 
He's got the elephant.

637
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:27,720
But we're not through yet.

638
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:32,560
Hang on to your turban, kid. 
We're gonna make you a star.

639
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:43,480
Sire, I've found a solution to 
the problem with your daughter.

640
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:46,520
Awk. The problem 
with your daughter.

641
00:38:46,520 --> 00:38:48,240
Oh, really?

642
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:49,120
Right here.

643
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:53,880
"If the princess has not chosen a 
husband by the appointed time,

644
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:56,800
"then the sultan shall 
choose for her."

645
00:38:56,800 --> 00:39:00,000
But Jasmine hated 
all those suitors.

646
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:02,000
How could I choose 
someone she hates?

647
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,760
Not to worry, my liege. 
There is more.

648
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:08,560
"If in the event a suitable 
prince cannot be found..."

649
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,600
Jerk.

650
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:13,400
"A princess must then be wed to..."

651
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:16,520
Hmm. Interesting.

652
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,200
What? Who?

653
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:19,760
The royal vizier.

654
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:23,440
Why, that would be me.

655
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:28,240
But I thought the law says that 
only a prince can marry a princess.

656
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,560
I'm quite sure that...

657
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:33,520
Desperate times call for 
desperate measures, my lord.

658
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:36,920
Yes. Desperate measures.

659
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:40,920
You will order the 
princess to marry me.

660
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:45,920
I will order the princess to...

661
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:48,440
But you're so old.

662
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:51,920
The princess will marry me.

663
00:39:51,920 --> 00:39:53,400
The princess will marry...

664
00:39:53,400 --> 00:39:56,080
What? What is that?

665
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:57,800
That music.

666
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:04,440
Jafar, you must come and see this.

667
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,120
<i>Make way for Prince Ali</i>

668
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:17,280
<i>Say, "Hey, it's Prince Ali"</i>

669
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,360
<i>Hey, clear the way 
in the old bazaar</i>

670
00:40:19,360 --> 00:40:21,920
<i>Hey you, let us through 
It's a bright new star</i>

671
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:25,840
<i>Oh come, be the first on your block 
To meet his eye</i>

672
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:29,440
<i>Make way, here he comes 
Ring bells, bang the drums</i>

673
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:31,400
<i>You're gonna love this guy</i>

674
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:36,200
<i>Prince Ali, fabulous he 
Ali Ababwa</i>

675
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:40,600
<i>Genuflect, show some respect 
Down on one knee</i>

676
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:43,440
<i>Now, try your best to stay calm</i>

677
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,520
<i>Brush up your Sunday salaam</i>

678
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:49,840
<i>Then come and meet 
His spectacular coterie</i>

679
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:54,400
<i>Prince Ali, mighty is he 
Ali Ababwa</i>

680
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:58,640
<i>Strong as 10 regular men definitely</i>

681
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,400
<i>He faced the galloping hordes</i>

682
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:03,640
<i>A hundred bad guys with swords</i>

683
00:41:03,640 --> 00:41:07,800
<i>Who sent those goons to 
their lords? Why, Prince Ali</i>

684
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:11,000
<i>He's got 75 golden camels</i>

685
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,480
Don't they look lovely, June?

686
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,240
<i>Purple peacocks, he's got 53</i>

687
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:16,840
Fabulous, Harry. 
I love the feathers.

688
00:41:16,840 --> 00:41:21,280
<i>When it comes to 
exotic-type mammals</i>

689
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,160
<i>Has he got a zoo 
I'm telling you</i>

690
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,400
<i>It's a world-class menagerie</i>

691
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,720
<i>Prince Ali, handsome is he 
Ali Ababwa</i>

692
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:34,320
<i>That physique, how can I speak 
Weak at the knee</i>

693
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:36,480
<i>Well, get on out in that square</i>

694
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:38,640
<i>Adjust your veil and prepare</i>

695
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:42,640
<i>To gawk and grovel and stare 
At Prince Ali</i>

696
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:46,640
<i>- He's got 95 white Persian monkeys 
- He's got the monkeys</i>

697
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:50,200
<i>- Let's see the monkeys 
- And to view them he charges no fee</i>

698
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,720
<i>He's generous 
So generous</i>

699
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,080
<i>He's got slaves 
He's got servants and flunkies</i>

700
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,680
<i>Proud to work for him 
They bow to his whim, love serving him</i>

701
00:41:57,680 --> 00:42:01,560
<i>They're just lousy 
with loyalty to Ali</i>

702
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:04,280
<i>Prince Ali</i>

703
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:10,680
<i>Prince Ali, Amorous he 
Ali Ababwa</i>

704
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:14,920
<i>Heard your princess 
Was a sight lovely to see</i>

705
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:16,920
<i>And that, good people, is why</i>

706
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:19,000
<i>He got dolled up and dropped by</i>

707
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,920
<i>With 60 elephants, llamas galore</i>

708
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,120
<i>With bears and lions 
A brass band and more</i>

709
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,800
<i>With his 40 fakirs 
His cooks, his bakers</i>

710
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,520
<i>His birds that warble on key</i>

711
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:28,600
<i>Make way</i>

712
00:42:28,600 --> 00:42:35,040
<i>For Prince Ali</i>

713
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:39,440
Splendid. Absolutely marvellous.

714
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:42,560
Your Majesty,

715
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:45,120
I have journeyed from afar to 
seek your daughter's hand.

716
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:46,880
Prince Ali Ababwa.

717
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:49,920
Of course. I'm 
delighted to meet you.

718
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,040
This is my royal vizier, 
Jafar. He's delighted, too.

719
00:42:54,040 --> 00:42:55,720
Ecstatic.

720
00:42:55,720 --> 00:42:58,640
- I'm afraid, Prince Abubu... 
- Ababwa.

721
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,840
Whatever.

722
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:02,880
You cannot just parade in here 
uninvited and expect to...

723
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:06,280
By Allah, this is quite 
a remarkable device.

724
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:07,800
Ooh.

725
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,360
I don't suppose I might...

726
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,440
Why, certainly, 
Your Majesty. Allow me.

727
00:43:15,440 --> 00:43:18,200
Sire, I must advise against this.

728
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:21,080
Oh, button up, Jafar. 
Learn to have a little fun.

729
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:23,120
Ow, ow, ow.

730
00:43:23,960 --> 00:43:25,240
Ahh! Whoa!

731
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:27,360
Look out, here I come.

732
00:43:29,680 --> 00:43:33,760
Just where did you 
say you were from?

733
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,440
Oh, much farther than 
you've travelled, I'm sure.

734
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,080
- Try me. 
- Look out, Polly.

735
00:43:43,080 --> 00:43:44,280
Hey, watch it.

736
00:43:44,280 --> 00:43:46,560
Watch it with the dumb rug.

737
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:48,520
Aah!

738
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:50,160
Whew!

739
00:43:56,040 --> 00:43:57,920
Out of the way. I'm 
coming in to land.

740
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,760
Jafar, watch this.

741
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:02,600
- Spectacular, Your Highness. 
- That was lovely.

742
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,760
Yes, I do seem to 
have a knack for it.

743
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:09,120
This is a very impressive youth.

744
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,360
And a prince besides.

745
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:14,880
If we're lucky, you won't have 
to marry Jasmine after all.

746
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,560
- I don't trust him, Sire. 
- Nonsense.

747
00:44:17,560 --> 00:44:22,040
One thing I pride myself on, Jafar, 
I'm an excellent judge of character.

748
00:44:22,040 --> 00:44:25,080
Oh, excellent judge. 
Yeah, sure. Not!

749
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:28,160
Jasmine will like this one.

750
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,320
And I'm pretty sure I'll 
like Princess Jasmine.

751
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:34,440
Your Highness, no. I must 
intercede on Jasmine's behalf.

752
00:44:34,440 --> 00:44:36,600
This boy is no different 
from the others.

753
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:39,280
What makes him think he is 
worthy of the princess?

754
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,480
Your Majesty, I am 
Prince Ali Ababwa.

755
00:44:42,480 --> 00:44:45,400
Just let her meet me. 
I will win your daughter.

756
00:44:45,400 --> 00:44:47,080
How dare you.

757
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,760
All of you. Standing 
around deciding my future?

758
00:44:50,760 --> 00:44:53,880
I am not a prize to be won.

759
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,160
Oh, dear.

760
00:44:56,680 --> 00:45:01,120
Don't worry, Prince Ali. Just 
give Jasmine time to cool down.

761
00:45:01,120 --> 00:45:06,320
I think it's time to say 
good-bye to Prince Abubu.

762
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:11,440
What am I gonna do?

763
00:45:11,440 --> 00:45:13,800
Jasmine won't even 
let me talk to her.

764
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:17,720
I should've known I couldn't pull 
off this stupid prince wish.

765
00:45:20,520 --> 00:45:22,680
So move.

766
00:45:23,640 --> 00:45:25,080
Hey.

767
00:45:26,120 --> 00:45:27,640
That's a good move.

768
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:30,360
I can't believe it. 
I'm losing to a rug.

769
00:45:30,840 --> 00:45:32,000
Genie, I need help.

770
00:45:32,000 --> 00:45:34,680
All right, Sparky, here's the deal.

771
00:45:34,680 --> 00:45:37,960
If you wanna court the little lady, 
you gotta be a straight shooter.

772
00:45:37,960 --> 00:45:40,360
- Do you got it? 
- What?

773
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:44,000
No way.

774
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,280
If Jasmine found out I was 
really some crummy street rat,

775
00:45:48,280 --> 00:45:49,480
she'd laugh at me.

776
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:52,320
A woman appreciates a man 
who can make her laugh.

777
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,360
Al, all joking aside, you 
really ought to be yourself.

778
00:45:57,360 --> 00:45:59,560
Hey, that's the last 
thing I wanna be.

779
00:45:59,560 --> 00:46:01,400
Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

780
00:46:01,400 --> 00:46:05,880
I just... I gotta be 
smooth, cool, confident.

781
00:46:06,840 --> 00:46:08,920
How do I look?

782
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:12,440
Like a prince.

783
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:26,600
Princess Jasmine?

784
00:46:27,320 --> 00:46:30,160
- Who's there? 
- It's me, Prince Ali.

785
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:33,640
Ahem. Uh, Prince Ali Ababwa.

786
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:35,240
I do not want to see you.

787
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:37,520
No, no, please, Princess. 
Give me a chance.

788
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,640
- Just leave me alone. 
- Down, kitty.

789
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:43,160
So, how's our little beau doing?

790
00:46:44,040 --> 00:46:46,440
Good kitty, take off.

791
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:47,600
Down, kitty.

792
00:46:47,600 --> 00:46:48,120
Wait. Wait.

793
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:51,160
Do I know you?

794
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:53,880
Uh, no. No.

795
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:58,000
You remind me of someone 
I met in the marketplace.

796
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:00,360
The marketplace?

797
00:47:00,360 --> 00:47:03,080
I have servants who go to 
the marketplace for me.

798
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:07,160
Why, I even have servants who go 
to the marketplace for my servants,

799
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:09,160
so it couldn't have 
been me you met.

800
00:47:09,600 --> 00:47:13,120
No. I guess not.

801
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:15,800
Enough about you, 
Casanova. Talk about her.

802
00:47:15,800 --> 00:47:18,480
She's smart, fun, 
the hair, the eyes.

803
00:47:18,480 --> 00:47:20,000
Anything. Pick a feature.

804
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:22,880
Ahem. Uh, Princess 
Jasmine? You're very...

805
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,600
Wonderful, magnificent, glorious,

806
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,920
- punctual. 
- Punctual.

807
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,160
- Punctual? 
- Sorry.

808
00:47:27,160 --> 00:47:29,560
- Uh, beautiful. 
- Nice recovery.

809
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:30,640
Hmm.

810
00:47:30,640 --> 00:47:32,640
I'm rich, too, you know.

811
00:47:32,920 --> 00:47:35,880
- Yeah. 
- The daughter of a sultan.

812
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,800
I know.

813
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,080
A fine prize for any 
prince to marry.

814
00:47:41,600 --> 00:47:43,880
Uh, right. Right. A prince like me.

815
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:45,480
Warning! Warning!

816
00:47:45,480 --> 00:47:47,960
Right. A prince like you.

817
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:51,720
And every other stuffed shirt, 
swaggering peacock I've met.

818
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,840
Mayday! Mayday!

819
00:47:54,680 --> 00:47:57,240
Just go jump off a balcony!

820
00:47:57,240 --> 00:47:59,400
- What? 
- Stop her. Stop her!

821
00:47:59,400 --> 00:48:01,200
- Want me to sting her? 
- Buzz off.

822
00:48:01,200 --> 00:48:04,920
Okay, fine. But remember, 
"bee" yourself.

823
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:06,840
- Yeah, right. 
- What?

824
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:09,720
Uh... Uh, you're right.

825
00:48:10,400 --> 00:48:14,120
You aren't just some 
prize to be won.

826
00:48:14,280 --> 00:48:16,760
You should be free to 
make your own choice.

827
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,240
I'll go now.

828
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:20,600
- No! 
- What? What?

829
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,040
How...

830
00:48:22,040 --> 00:48:23,720
How are you doing that?

831
00:48:23,720 --> 00:48:26,120
- It's a magic carpet. 
- It's lovely.

832
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:28,120
You, uh...

833
00:48:29,520 --> 00:48:32,240
You don't want to go 
for a ride, do you?

834
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,120
We could get out of the 
palace, see the world.

835
00:48:35,120 --> 00:48:37,800
- Is it safe? 
- Sure. Do you trust me?

836
00:48:39,080 --> 00:48:41,720
- What? 
- Do you trust me?

837
00:48:43,640 --> 00:48:45,400
Yes.

838
00:49:00,000 --> 00:49:03,680
<i>I can show you the world</i>

839
00:49:03,880 --> 00:49:07,560
<i>Shining, shimmering, splendid</i>

840
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:09,240
<i>Tell me, Princess</i>

841
00:49:09,240 --> 00:49:14,120
<i>Now, when did you last 
Let your heart decide</i>

842
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:18,840
<i>I can open your eyes</i>

843
00:49:18,840 --> 00:49:22,440
<i>Take you wonder by wonder</i>

844
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:25,240
<i>Over, sideways and under</i>

845
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:28,680
<i>On a magic carpet ride</i>

846
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:32,520
<i>A whole new world</i>

847
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:36,120
<i>A new fantastic point of view</i>

848
00:49:36,120 --> 00:49:40,760
<i>No one to tell us no 
Or where to go</i>

849
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:43,400
<i>Or say we're only dreaming</i>

850
00:49:43,400 --> 00:49:47,080
<i>A whole new world</i>

851
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:50,120
<i>A dazzling place 
I never knew</i>

852
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:55,400
<i>But when I'm way up here 
It's crystal clear</i>

853
00:49:55,400 --> 00:49:59,480
<i>That now I'm in 
A whole new world with you</i>

854
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:03,040
<i>Now I'm in 
A whole new world with you</i>

855
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,800
<i>Unbelievable sights</i>

856
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,280
<i>Indescribable feeling</i>

857
00:50:10,280 --> 00:50:13,240
<i>Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling</i>

858
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,320
<i>Through an endless diamond sky</i>

859
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:20,120
<i>- A whole new world 
- Don't you dare close your eyes</i>

860
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:23,800
<i>- A hundred thousand things to see 
- Hold your breath, it gets better</i>

861
00:50:23,800 --> 00:50:27,960
<i>I'm like a shooting star 
I've come so far</i>

862
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:31,280
<i>I can't go back to 
where I used to be</i>

863
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,440
<i>- A whole new world 
- Every turn a surprise</i>

864
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:38,360
<i>- With new horizons to pursue 
- Every moment red-letter</i>

865
00:50:38,360 --> 00:50:42,760
<i>I'll chase them anywhere 
There's time to spare</i>

866
00:50:42,760 --> 00:50:49,240
<i>Let me share 
This whole new world with you</i>

867
00:50:49,240 --> 00:50:52,880
<i>- A whole new world 
- A whole new world</i>

868
00:50:52,880 --> 00:50:56,760
<i>- That's where we'll be 
- That's where we'll be</i>

869
00:50:56,760 --> 00:51:00,880
<i>- A thrilling chase 
- A wondrous place</i>

870
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:04,920
<i>For you and me</i>

871
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:21,600
- It's all so magical. 
- Yeah.

872
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:25,880
It's a shame Abu had to miss this.

873
00:51:25,880 --> 00:51:28,040
Nah. He hates fireworks.

874
00:51:28,040 --> 00:51:29,880
He doesn't like flying, either.

875
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,800
Uh, that is, um... Oh, no.

876
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:35,960
You are the boy from 
the market. I knew it.

877
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,280
- Why did you lie to me? 
- Jasmine, I'm sorry.

878
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:40,000
- Did you think I was stupid? 
- No.

879
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:41,920
- That I wouldn't figure it out? 
- No.

880
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:45,960
I mean, I hoped you wouldn't. 
No, that's not what I meant.

881
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:47,960
Who are you? Tell me the truth.

882
00:51:47,960 --> 00:51:50,040
The truth?

883
00:51:51,640 --> 00:51:53,520
The truth. Um...

884
00:51:54,520 --> 00:51:56,240
The truth is...

885
00:51:56,240 --> 00:51:59,200
I sometimes dress 
as a commoner, um,

886
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,040
to escape the pressures 
of palace life.

887
00:52:03,640 --> 00:52:05,960
But I really am a prince.

888
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,080
Why didn't you just tell me?

889
00:52:09,080 --> 00:52:11,360
Well, you know,

890
00:52:11,360 --> 00:52:13,880
royalty going out into 
the city in disguise,

891
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,320
it sounds a little 
strange, don't you think?

892
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:17,960
Hmm.

893
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:20,120
Not that strange.

894
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:44,600
Good night, my handsome prince.

895
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,440
Sleep well, Princess.

896
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:14,240
Jasmine.

897
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,080
Oh, Father, I just had 
the most wonderful time.

898
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:21,720
- I'm so happy. 
- You should be, Jasmine.

899
00:53:21,720 --> 00:53:24,720
I have chosen a husband for you.

900
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,520
- What? 
- You will wed Jafar.

901
00:53:28,880 --> 00:53:32,000
You're speechless, I see. 
A fine quality in a wife.

902
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,200
I will never marry you.

903
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:37,880
- Father, I choose Prince Ali. 
- Prince Ali left.

904
00:53:37,880 --> 00:53:40,000
Better check your crystal 
ball again, Jafar.

905
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:41,720
Prince Ali!

906
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:44,600
How in the... Uh. Awk!

907
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:48,040
Tell them the truth, Jafar. 
You tried to have me killed.

908
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:51,080
What? Ridiculous 
nonsense, Your Highness.

909
00:53:51,080 --> 00:53:53,200
He is obviously lying.

910
00:53:53,200 --> 00:53:55,600
Obviously lying.

911
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,640
Father, what's wrong with you?

912
00:53:57,640 --> 00:53:59,680
I know what's wrong.

913
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:02,360
Oh, my!

914
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,960
Your Highness, Jafar's been 
controlling you with this.

915
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,960
What? Jafar?

916
00:54:07,960 --> 00:54:10,360
You, you traitor!

917
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:12,480
Your Majesty, all this 
can be explained.

918
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:14,520
Guards! Guards!

919
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,640
Well, that's it. 
We're dead. Forget it.

920
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,520
Just dig a grave for both 
of us. We're dead.

921
00:54:18,520 --> 00:54:21,520
Arrest Jafar at once.

922
00:54:21,520 --> 00:54:24,120
This is not done yet, boy.

923
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:30,840
Find him! Search everywhere!

924
00:54:30,840 --> 00:54:33,320
- Jasmine, are you all right? 
- Yes.

925
00:54:33,320 --> 00:54:36,240
Jafar, my most trusted counsellor,

926
00:54:36,240 --> 00:54:37,760
plotting against me all this time.

927
00:54:37,760 --> 00:54:40,080
This is horrible, just horrible.

928
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,280
How will I ever...

929
00:54:42,280 --> 00:54:43,960
Huh?

930
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:46,040
Can this be true?

931
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:49,600
My daughter has finally 
chosen a suitor?

932
00:54:49,600 --> 00:54:53,040
Ha, ha! Praise Allah!

933
00:54:53,840 --> 00:54:56,360
You brilliant boy, 
I could kiss you.

934
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,840
I won't. I'll leave that to my...

935
00:54:59,000 --> 00:55:01,400
But you two will be wed at once.

936
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:04,520
Yes, yes. And you'll be 
happy and prosperous,

937
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:07,760
and then you, my boy, 
will become sultan.

938
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:08,960
- Sultan? 
- Yes.

939
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,200
A fine upstanding youth 
such as yourself,

940
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,560
a person of your unimpeachable 
moral character

941
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:17,080
is exactly what this kingdom needs.

942
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:20,840
We gotta get outta here. I gotta 
start packing. Only essentials.

943
00:55:20,840 --> 00:55:21,880
We gotta travel light.

944
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:25,080
Bring the guns, the weapons, the 
knives, and how about this picture?

945
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:27,800
I think I'm making 
a weird face in it.

946
00:55:30,240 --> 00:55:34,120
Oh, boy. He's cracked. 
He's gone nuts.

947
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:38,040
Jafar! Jafar! Get a grip!

948
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,640
Good grip.

949
00:55:39,640 --> 00:55:43,480
Prince Ali is nothing more than 
that ragged urchin, Aladdin.

950
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:46,560
- He has the lamp, Iago. 
- Why, that miserable...

951
00:55:46,560 --> 00:55:49,120
But you are going to 
relieve him of it.

952
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,640
Me?

953
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,920
Sultan?

954
00:55:55,920 --> 00:55:57,640
They want me to be Sultan?

955
00:55:58,440 --> 00:56:00,080
Huzzah!

956
00:56:00,080 --> 00:56:02,760
<i>Hail the conquering hero</i>

957
00:56:10,040 --> 00:56:12,920
Aladdin, you've just won 
the heart of the princess.

958
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:15,360
What are you gonna do next?

959
00:56:20,880 --> 00:56:25,440
Psst. Your line is, "I'm 
going to free the genie."

960
00:56:25,560 --> 00:56:26,680
Any time.

961
00:56:26,680 --> 00:56:30,000
- Genie. I can't. 
- Sure you can.

962
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:33,360
You just go, "Genie, 
I wish you free."

963
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:34,960
I'm serious.

964
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:38,520
Look, I'm sorry. I really am. 
But they wanna make me sultan.

965
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,560
No. They wanna make 
Prince Ali sultan.

966
00:56:41,560 --> 00:56:44,080
Without you, I'm just Aladdin.

967
00:56:44,080 --> 00:56:46,400
- Al, you won. 
- Because of you.

968
00:56:46,400 --> 00:56:49,880
The only reason anyone thinks I'm 
worth anything is because of you.

969
00:56:49,880 --> 00:56:52,040
What if they find out I'm 
not really a prince?

970
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:55,560
What if Jasmine finds out? 
I'd lose her.

971
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:58,920
Genie, I can't keep 
this up on my own.

972
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:01,640
I can't wish you free.

973
00:57:02,720 --> 00:57:06,120
Fine. I understand. After all, 
you've lied to everyone else.

974
00:57:06,120 --> 00:57:08,600
Hey, I was beginning 
to feel left out.

975
00:57:08,600 --> 00:57:11,760
Now, if you'll excuse me, master.

976
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:17,080
Genie, I'm really sorry.

977
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:22,280
Well, fine. Then 
just stay in there.

978
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:25,400
What are you guys looking at?

979
00:57:28,640 --> 00:57:30,720
Look, I... I'm sorry.

980
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:32,880
Abu, I'm sorry. I didn't...

981
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:35,200
Wait. Come on.

982
00:57:40,320 --> 00:57:42,360
What am I doing?

983
00:57:42,960 --> 00:57:45,400
Genie's right.

984
00:57:46,560 --> 00:57:48,720
I gotta tell Jasmine the truth.

985
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:52,240
Ali. Oh, Ali. Will you come here?

986
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:55,440
Well, here goes.

987
00:57:55,480 --> 00:57:57,840
Jasmine? Where are you?

988
00:57:58,080 --> 00:57:59,960
Out in the menagerie. Hurry.

989
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:02,360
I'm coming.

990
00:58:04,920 --> 00:58:08,440
You got a problem, Pinky?

991
00:58:08,440 --> 00:58:09,560
Jerk.

992
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:14,880
Boy, Jafar's gonna 
be happy to see you.

993
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:16,480
"Excellent work, Iago."

994
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:17,760
Ah, go on.

995
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,520
"No, really. On a scale of 
one to 10, you are an 11."

996
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:23,840
Oh, Jafar, you're too kind.

997
00:58:23,840 --> 00:58:26,160
I'm embarrassed. I'm blushing.

998
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:29,400
People of Agrabah,

999
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:34,200
my daughter has finally 
chosen a suitor.

1000
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:36,480
Jasmine.

1001
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,640
Ali, where have you been?

1002
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,600
Jasmine, there's something 
I got to tell you.

1003
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,600
The whole kingdom's turned out 
for Father's announcement.

1004
00:58:43,600 --> 00:58:46,080
No. But, Jasmine, 
listen to me, please.

1005
00:58:46,080 --> 00:58:47,640
- You don't understand... 
- Good luck.

1006
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:50,520
Ali Ababwa!

1007
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,320
Oh, boy.

1008
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:02,560
Ahh!

1009
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:09,600
Get your blasted 
beak out of my face.

1010
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:13,120
- Oh, shut up, you moron. 
- Don't tell me to shut up.

1011
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:14,320
Allow me.

1012
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:18,240
Ten thousand years in a Cave of 
Wonders ought to chill him out.

1013
00:59:20,200 --> 00:59:22,760
Shut up!

1014
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:29,920
Jasmine...

1015
00:59:30,360 --> 00:59:33,200
I'm sorry I lied to you 
about being a prince.

1016
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,000
I know why you did.

1017
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:40,120
Well, I guess this is good-bye?

1018
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:44,320
Oh, that stupid law. 
This isn't fair.

1019
00:59:44,600 --> 00:59:46,520
I love you.

1020
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:51,040
Al, no problem. You've 
still got one wish left.

1021
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:53,120
Just say the word and 
you're a prince again.

1022
00:59:53,120 --> 00:59:55,200
But, Genie, what 
about your freedom?

1023
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:58,280
Hey, it's only an 
eternity of servitude.

1024
00:59:58,280 --> 01:00:00,200
This is love.

1025
01:00:00,200 --> 01:00:04,480
Al, you're not gonna find another 
girl like her in a million years.

1026
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,040
Believe me, I know. I've looked.

1027
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:09,920
Jasmine, I do love you,

1028
01:00:09,920 --> 01:00:13,600
but I got to stop pretending 
to be something I'm not.

1029
01:00:13,640 --> 01:00:15,800
I understand.

1030
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:19,840
Genie, I wish for your freedom.

1031
01:00:19,840 --> 01:00:22,560
One bona fide prince 
pedigree coming up.

1032
01:00:22,560 --> 01:00:26,080
- What? 
- Genie, you're free.

1033
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:48,360
I'm free. I'm free.

1034
01:00:48,360 --> 01:00:50,640
Quick. Quick. Wish for 
something outrageous.

1035
01:00:50,640 --> 01:00:52,920
Say, "I want the Nile." 
Wish for the Nile. Try that.

1036
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,680
- Uh, I wish for the Nile. 
- No way!

1037
01:00:57,200 --> 01:00:59,680
Oh, does that feel good! Oh!

1038
01:00:59,680 --> 01:01:02,120
I'm free! I'm free at last!

1039
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:06,560
I'm hittin' the road. I'm off 
to see the world. I'm...

1040
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:16,240
Genie, I'm...

1041
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:18,720
I'm gonna miss you.

1042
01:01:18,720 --> 01:01:21,280
Me, too, Al.

1043
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,640
No matter what anybody says,

1044
01:01:25,080 --> 01:01:28,040
you'll always be a prince to me.

1045
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:29,880
That's right.

1046
01:01:29,880 --> 01:01:33,400
You've certainly proven your 
worth as far as I'm concerned.

1047
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:36,440
It's that law that's the problem.

1048
01:01:36,440 --> 01:01:39,560
- Father? 
- Well, am I sultan or am I sultan?

1049
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,200
From this day forth,

1050
01:01:41,200 --> 01:01:45,960
the princess shall marry 
whomever she deems worthy.

1051
01:01:45,960 --> 01:01:48,800
Him. I choose...

1052
01:01:49,400 --> 01:01:52,480
I choose you, Aladdin.

1053
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:55,880
Call me Al.

1054
01:01:56,400 --> 01:01:59,760
Oh, all of you, come over 
here. Big group hug.

1055
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:01,480
Group hug.

1056
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,480
Mind if I kiss the monkey?

1057
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:04,960
Ooh, hairball.

1058
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:07,480
Well, I can't do any more damage 
around this Popsicle stand.

1059
01:02:07,480 --> 01:02:09,920
I'm outta here!

1060
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,320
Bye-bye, you two crazy lovebirds!

1061
01:02:12,320 --> 01:02:14,960
Hey, Rugman, ciao. I'm history.

1062
01:02:14,960 --> 01:02:16,600
No, I'm mythology.

1063
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:19,880
I don't care what I am. I'm free!

1064
01:02:22,400 --> 01:02:24,920
<i>A whole new world</i>

1065
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:27,600
<i>A whole new life</i>

1066
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:33,280
<i>For you and me</i>

1067
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:37,280
<i>A whole new world</i>

1068
01:02:49,120 --> 01:02:51,560
Made you look.

1069
01:07:13,400 --> 01:07:15,720
<i>You have been a fabulous audience.</i>

1070
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:17,880
<i>Tell you what, you're the best 
audience in the whole world.</i>

1071
01:07:17,880 --> 01:07:20,480
<i>Take care of yourselves. 
Good night, Alice!</i>

1072
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:24,640
<i>Good night, Agrabah!</i> Adiós, amigos!
