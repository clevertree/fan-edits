1
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,641
We lost 300 ryo, thanks 
to your meddling.

2
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,436
We won't go back empty-handed.

3
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,898
If your hands are so 
empty, will you hold this?

4
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,304
Is it true they hired you 
for only twenty ryo?

5
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,388
Yes.

6
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:42,268
The sword we stole was a treasure 
given to them by the Shogun.

7
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,397
And they'll only pay 
twenty to get it back?

8
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,317
Ridiculous!

9
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,736
They're a poor, small clan.

10
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,406
Trying to swindle 300 ryo for 
a sword is asking too much.

11
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,410
Shut up! Damn you!

12
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,208
Looks like a nasty 
storm's brewing...

13
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,043
Can't waste my time here!

14
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:14,342
Ninja Scroll

15
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,910
Oh, I'm sorry for you.

16
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,162
That was one hell of a storm!

17
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,165
That's right! My roof got blown 
off and scared my wife so bad...

18
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,958
...that she went into labor.

19
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,627
It was really something.

20
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,004
That's your seventh kid, right?

21
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,505
Nope, the ninth.

22
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,634
Whoa! You must really 
love your wife!

23
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:43,222
Isn't that Sakichi's daughter 
from Shimoda Village?

24
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,225
What's with her?

25
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,232
What's wrong?!

26
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,241
All... dead...

27
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,078
Everybody's dead.

28
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,455
Dead?!

29
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,709
Plague... Plague did it...

30
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,675
My god !

31
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,136
This area's off limits! 
No one goes through!

32
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,807
This road's closed until 
the epidemic is over.

33
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,184
Epidemic?! The hell with that!

34
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,729
What is it?

35
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,525
Sir, my scout saw a 
strange group of men

36
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,696
ride toward Shimoda 
Village late last night.

37
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,157
It might have something 
to do with this

38
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,660
epidemic so I came to 
tell you, Chamberlain.

39
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:51,291
Meaning what? That they spread a plague 
as they passed through the village?

40
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,876
Ridiculous! Why 
would they do that?

41
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,379
Something's fishy.

42
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,339
Let it alone.

43
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,262
On second thought, we can't.

44
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,764
This is the order to 
all of you Koga ninja.

45
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,851
Go to Shimoda Village and 
find what really happened.

46
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,893
Sir!

47
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,188
One more thing. If any of 
your people get infected...

48
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,816
Understood, sir.

49
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,819
The first group will follow the 
Shirakawa River from the north.

50
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,197
The second will cross 
Taro Pass from the west.

51
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,200
You'll reach Shimoda Village 
in about an hour. Understand?

52
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,872
Hikoza saw them. There were only eight. 
No match for us.

53
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,875
Our real enemy is this epidemic.

54
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,627
True.

55
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,389
Kagero...

56
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,067
You intend to leave 
me behind, Hanza?

57
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,862
You have your own 
duties, don't you?

58
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,115
Poison tasting is very important. 
Don't forget that.

59
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:11,079
While our lord is away from his 
domain, the work isn't necessary.

60
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,706
Until he returns...

61
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,083
I am one of the Koga ninja!

62
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,086
I cannot take you.

63
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,089
You could all be 
killed out there.

64
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,426
How can I just sit and 
wait here alone?!

65
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,905
Kagero's gotten even 
more beautiful.

66
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,116
All the more reason to pity her.

67
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,701
It's her destiny. 
She must hate it.

68
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,330
Enough. Where are 
Hikoza and the others?

69
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,291
They were right behind us. 
I'll have a look.

70
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,433
Hey! What are you doing?

71
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,022
What the...?!

72
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,426
There!

73
00:08:07,195 --> 00:08:07,987
Shit!

74
00:08:20,041 --> 00:08:22,210
Who was that freak?

75
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:26,005
Forget it. I don't want 
to see him again, anyway.

76
00:08:27,256 --> 00:08:29,217
I am 
Kagero of the Koga ninja.

77
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:33,888
Jubei. Kibagami Jubei.

78
00:08:35,097 --> 00:08:38,267
The town of Kakio is to the west. 
Our paths part here.

79
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:30,111
Oh, hi...

80
00:09:32,154 --> 00:09:34,782
I know the way now, so...

81
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:39,704
Ow...

82
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:43,291
Okay, I got it. Are we done now?

83
00:09:44,208 --> 00:09:47,628
There's no reason we 
should kill each other.

84
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,718
If you're not going to end this... 
I will!

85
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:56,762
Like hell!

86
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:10,985
Strange skill you have. But 
it can't hurt my body.

87
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:13,654
Seems that way.

88
00:10:28,085 --> 00:10:32,006
What's wrong, Monster? Your 
skin's starting to crumble!

89
00:10:35,176 --> 00:10:36,469
Die!

90
00:11:01,243 --> 00:11:03,371
Splendid !

91
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:06,832
Your sword flew swift 
as the wind itself and

92
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:10,169
slashed your enemy like 
a cyclone's touch.

93
00:11:11,462 --> 00:11:15,216
He was no match for you. 
Why don't you join me?

94
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:20,054
Your skills will be of great help 
for me to fight the likes of him.

95
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,226
You're joking. Who'd want to 
fight a monster like him again?

96
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,230
You'll have to. They 
won't leave you alone.

97
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:33,317
You just killed one of the 
Eight Devils of Kimon.

98
00:11:34,860 --> 00:11:38,864
You didn't beat him 
by yourself, though.

99
00:11:40,282 --> 00:11:44,787
That Koga ninja woman... 
Interesting technique she uses.

100
00:12:01,554 --> 00:12:05,266
Lord Genma. All is 
proceeding as planned.

101
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:16,026
It arrives from the Shogun of the 
Dark by six tomorrow evening.

102
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:21,407
Very well. Write 
to him in return.

103
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:27,955
"We return in three days. There's 
nothing to worry about."

104
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,123
At once.

105
00:13:13,167 --> 00:13:16,795
Where are you headed?

106
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:20,758
No place in particular. You?

107
00:13:21,383 --> 00:13:27,431
I'm looking for somebody, and you 
look exactly like him, so...

108
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:32,144
Strangers can look alike. I'm 
Kibagami Jubei, a wanderer...

109
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,450
It was most certainly your face.

110
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,704
Tessai was able to make 
an impression of it.

111
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:09,181
Just leave me the hell alone!

112
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:20,150
A cast-off skin.

113
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,612
She shed it like a 
snake and escaped.

114
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,367
A gang of freaks, one and all.

115
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:35,040
You've no obligation. I just 
didn't want you to die yet.

116
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,335
Who are these Eight 
Devils of Kimon?

117
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,463
A group of ninja who work 
for the Shogun of the Dark.

118
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,424
You know of the 
Shogun of the Dark?

119
00:14:43,090 --> 00:14:46,510
He wants to rebuild the Toyotomi 
clan, the former rulers of Japan.

120
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:50,848
He has 16 lords behind him and is 
trying to expand his influence.

121
00:14:50,848 --> 00:14:54,018
The most dangerous enemy 
of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

122
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:58,480
His power is supported in the 
shadows by the Eight Devils.

123
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,025
What are they up to 
here in Mochizuki?

124
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:05,404
That's what I came here to find out. 
It's a tough job.

125
00:15:06,906 --> 00:15:10,075
Why don't you work for 
me, for 100 ryo?

126
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,038
A Tokugawa spy wants 
to hire a ninja?

127
00:15:15,706 --> 00:15:18,208
I'm afraid I have no choice. 
It's an emergency.

128
00:15:18,208 --> 00:15:21,629
Only I managed to make 
it here to Mochizuki.

129
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,506
The Eight Devils killed everyone 
else in my party on our way here.

130
00:15:24,506 --> 00:15:27,134
I need your help by all means!

131
00:15:28,135 --> 00:15:31,138
You'll never get away from them.

132
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,474
You'll have to fight 
them sooner or later.

133
00:15:33,474 --> 00:15:36,685
Join me. You can kill two 
birds with one stone, right?

134
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:41,148
I don't think so. Now why don't 
you just leave me alone?

135
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,111
I see. Too bad.

136
00:15:46,904 --> 00:15:48,822
Such a pity...

137
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:54,995
You'll lose your precious life.

138
00:15:56,372 --> 00:15:57,498
You're stubborn.

139
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:01,585
No, what I speak of is literally of 
life or death importance to you.

140
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:06,131
You see, that shuriken 
was poisoned.

141
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,676
It won't kill you instantly, 
but in a day and a

142
00:16:08,676 --> 00:16:11,470
night, when it starts to 
work, nothing can stop it.

143
00:16:13,097 --> 00:16:17,559
Unless you get the antidote. 
And only I know what it is.

144
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,396
Work for me and I'll tell 
you the antidote along

145
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:22,856
with the hundred ryo 
when the job is done.

146
00:16:24,024 --> 00:16:25,901
You're bluffing.

147
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:33,075
I speak the truth.

148
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:36,120
Tell me now. What's 
the antidote?

149
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:41,208
Not until you work for me. Kill 
me and you've killed yourself!

150
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,882
Now you'll need the 
antidote for yourself.

151
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:52,344
Poor boy... You've 
so much to learn.

152
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:55,139
That isn't the one that hit you.

153
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,475
I threw THAT one away.

154
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,604
Shit!

155
00:17:03,647 --> 00:17:08,193
Kibagami Jubei... You've lost... 
amateur!

156
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,948
My name is Dakuan. 
How do you do?

157
00:17:17,619 --> 00:17:18,620
So, Benisato...

158
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:23,125
This man, Kibagami Jubei, is a 
remnant of the Shogunate's spies?

159
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,085
Possibly.

160
00:17:25,085 --> 00:17:27,129
Why didn't you kill him?

161
00:17:27,296 --> 00:17:28,881
Someone interfered.

162
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,132
No excuses!

163
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:37,473
If he's a government spy, 
he'll show up here soon.

164
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,516
Be sure to kill him this time.

165
00:17:39,975 --> 00:17:42,019
I don't need your 
advice to do that.

166
00:17:46,982 --> 00:17:48,525
Jubei...

167
00:17:48,942 --> 00:17:52,905
There's something 
I've been wondering.

168
00:17:53,614 --> 00:17:56,742
Are you, by chance, the 
ninja who killed the chief

169
00:17:56,742 --> 00:17:59,661
retainers of the Yamashiro 
clan five years ago?

170
00:18:00,579 --> 00:18:04,166
He was supposedly a master 
swordsman, like you.

171
00:18:07,211 --> 00:18:10,089
The retainers had 
gorged themselves with

172
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,258
gold they secretly dug 
out of a hidden mine.

173
00:18:13,509 --> 00:18:17,096
The ninja must have killed 
them by order of the lord

174
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,764
who wanted to report the 
mine to the government.

175
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:22,684
Because if the government found 
the hidden gold mine first...

176
00:18:22,684 --> 00:18:24,603
the lord would have 
lost his fief.

177
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:29,858
But does that ninja know that after 
the retainers were killed...

178
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,444
the government received 
no report about the mine?

179
00:18:33,278 --> 00:18:34,404
Why?

180
00:18:34,404 --> 00:18:40,035
If a government spy like you knows all 
that, then why don't you do something?

181
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:45,707
No... Even the government can't 
move without definite evidence.

182
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:48,836
Our spies tried many 
times to infiltrate the

183
00:18:48,836 --> 00:18:52,214
clan to find evidence, 
but none returned alive.

184
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:53,757
The Shogun of the Dark...

185
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:57,052
He stopped them by 
using the Kimon ninja.

186
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:01,139
Why is the Shogun of the Dark 
helping the Yamashiro clan?

187
00:19:01,723 --> 00:19:05,602
Simple. He wants the 
gold mine for himself.

188
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:11,984
Do you know how he found the 
mine before the government?

189
00:19:12,609 --> 00:19:15,154
Somebody gave him 
the information.

190
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,740
Somebody who was the leader of 
the ninja of the Yamashiro clan.

191
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,702
Himuro... Genma?!

192
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:24,705
Precisely.

193
00:19:25,914 --> 00:19:29,376
I doubt that. He isn't 
in this world anymore.

194
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:33,463
No, he's still very much alive. 
And you'll see him soon.

195
00:19:33,463 --> 00:19:36,717
Himuro Genma is the boss 
of the Kimon monsters.

196
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:39,803
Shh! Not so loud !

197
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:41,847
You can't trick me 
the same way again!

198
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:46,101
Don't be hasty. You'll 
soon know the truth.

199
00:19:46,101 --> 00:19:51,648
But you must admit that you 
and he share a strange fate.

200
00:19:57,196 --> 00:20:00,032
Stop! You'd kill 
your own friend?!

201
00:20:00,032 --> 00:20:03,493
The lord orders it! 
As did our leader!

202
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:06,538
It's a trick!

203
00:20:06,538 --> 00:20:09,082
Now that we know the 
traitors' secret they want

204
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:11,543
to get rid of us by making 
us kill each other.

205
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:15,839
This is a trap for all of us. 
Shinkuro, believe me!

206
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:18,550
Jubei... Forgive me.

207
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,135
Shinkuro!

208
00:20:21,094 --> 00:20:22,429
His word...

209
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:23,847
...is law!

210
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:08,141
I avenged Shinkuro and the others myself. 
Genma can't be alive.

211
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:13,730
We're getting close. This place 
is thick with ghosts and blood.

212
00:21:13,897 --> 00:21:16,358
Beyond lies Hell itself.

213
00:21:20,612 --> 00:21:24,616
Heaven must have sent 
this mist to help us.

214
00:21:39,798 --> 00:21:41,008
Hey!

215
00:21:49,182 --> 00:21:51,018
Double damned mist!

216
00:22:14,875 --> 00:22:18,378
How could he have 
dodged Shijima's claw?

217
00:22:46,740 --> 00:22:47,866
Who are you?

218
00:22:47,866 --> 00:22:51,286
I heard a voice 
chanting the sutra.

219
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:54,831
I was praying for 
the dead villagers.

220
00:22:55,832 --> 00:22:59,586
Don't you know an epidemic 
plagues this village?

221
00:23:01,129 --> 00:23:05,926
Poor soul! You'll never 
leave this village alive.

222
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,763
Here now, let us go to the 
land of Buddha together.

223
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:19,398
Have you seen a 
traveling monk here?

224
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:25,529
He'll meet Buddha soon enough. 
I'll send him there.

225
00:23:26,321 --> 00:23:27,989
Such a benevolent nun...

226
00:23:36,456 --> 00:23:38,291
Shit! Another cast-off skin!

227
00:23:48,885 --> 00:23:52,806
Gone... He uses a 
strange technique...

228
00:24:03,525 --> 00:24:05,735
As do you. Very strange indeed !

229
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:21,751
Answer me. Are there any others 
with you besides the monk?

230
00:24:22,627 --> 00:24:26,131
Of course. And not 
just ten or twenty.

231
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:28,508
You can send a snake for 
each and it won't be enough.

232
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:32,220
Liar!

233
00:24:32,804 --> 00:24:35,599
All right! I'll 
tell you the truth.

234
00:24:36,683 --> 00:24:40,395
There's two. One's the traveling monk. 
The other...

235
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,855
...is right behind you.

236
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,152
Lose the snakes. Down 
to the last one!

237
00:24:53,366 --> 00:24:54,618
You'll be dead soon.

238
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:00,165
Get rid of them!

239
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:20,977
Now it's your turn to answer.

240
00:25:20,977 --> 00:25:23,813
What are you doing in this village? 
Talk!

241
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,377
Twice failed. Unforgivable.

242
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:49,381
I cast another line onto your 
neck, but you didn't notice.

243
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,133
In the end, just a 
foolish amateur.

244
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,821
Idiot! There's still time 
to suck the poison out!

245
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:17,242
Poison doesn't work on me. 
My body's immune to it.

246
00:26:19,995 --> 00:26:22,497
I think I've cleared 
my debt to you.

247
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:25,208
Yes. You saved me.

248
00:26:25,458 --> 00:26:29,713
Your name's Kagero, right? 
What are you going to do now?

249
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:32,090
That's none of your concern.

250
00:26:33,008 --> 00:26:35,176
If it isn't, then what the 
hell am I doing here?!

251
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:38,847
I have to discover their plan.

252
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,017
By yourself? Impossible!

253
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:44,185
They're too strong. 
Think this over.

254
00:26:44,686 --> 00:26:46,396
Stay out of my way.

255
00:26:46,396 --> 00:26:49,566
I've no reason to 
take orders from you.

256
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:55,655
Hold a moment, Kunoichi of Koga.

257
00:26:55,655 --> 00:27:00,577
My name is Dakuan. Why 
don't you join me?

258
00:27:00,577 --> 00:27:04,372
This man is my 
trustworthy assistant.

259
00:27:04,873 --> 00:27:07,375
I wasn't planning on 
helping a government spy.

260
00:27:07,375 --> 00:27:09,544
Oh, quit complaining !

261
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:10,920
What do you say, woman?

262
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:15,592
Our aims may differ, but we 
three share a common enemy.

263
00:27:15,592 --> 00:27:18,553
And three is mightier than one.

264
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:21,973
And I happen to have some 
information you don't know.

265
00:27:21,973 --> 00:27:25,018
Such as who is giving 
them their orders.

266
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:27,103
I'll tell you on the way.

267
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,233
I need no friends.

268
00:27:32,859 --> 00:27:36,738
But I may need your information.

269
00:27:36,738 --> 00:27:38,281
Very well.

270
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:49,125
My, she's a lovely, sexy 
little thing, isn't she!

271
00:27:49,584 --> 00:27:52,420
What's running through that 
twisted skull of yours?

272
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:56,633
Well now, that Kunoichi 
could prove very useful.

273
00:27:56,633 --> 00:28:00,428
She has a technique to poison 
the man she sleeps with.

274
00:28:00,970 --> 00:28:05,684
The big guy you killed had 
been poisoned by her.

275
00:28:05,684 --> 00:28:05,767
The big guy you killed had 
been poisoned by her.

276
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:56,401
Your skill is as 
marvelous as ever.

277
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:59,821
No... He was able to kill a 
mighty ninja like Tessai.

278
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:03,867
Don't be off guard. It's 
possible he got away.

279
00:29:04,451 --> 00:29:06,703
The four of you 
will check it out.

280
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:08,872
You're a cautious one, Yurimaru.

281
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:14,127
We have an important mission. 
We take every precaution.

282
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,087
I know, I know. Don't worry.

283
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,805
Only things he killed 
were the fish.

284
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,349
Good. Otherwise we 
wouldn't get our chance.

285
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:30,602
It's getting quite 
interesting, isn't it?

286
00:29:45,408 --> 00:29:48,578
How is it? Just as we thought?

287
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:52,457
They poisoned the wells 
and killed the villagers.

288
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,542
And then blamed it on plague.

289
00:29:55,210 --> 00:29:58,463
A trick to keep the 
villagers away.

290
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:04,135
They're planning something... 
quite extraordinary.

291
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,524
I'd like to know what it is.

292
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:21,069
That's fine, just don't get 
yourself involved too deeply.

293
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:22,779
It could prove fatal.

294
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,469
I see. Guide the others.

295
00:31:04,404 --> 00:31:05,613
Run for it!

296
00:31:27,719 --> 00:31:29,679
We can't outrun them.

297
00:31:31,556 --> 00:31:32,724
Kagero...

298
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,745
So, the pollen is mixed 
with a sleeping potion.

299
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,663
But how long will 
it hold them back?

300
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,124
Why, you!

301
00:31:58,917 --> 00:31:59,918
Girl!

302
00:32:00,126 --> 00:32:02,462
You have to hold them off 
till Jubei kills him!

303
00:32:02,462 --> 00:32:04,422
Do whatever it takes!

304
00:32:18,686 --> 00:32:20,438
Call off your bees!

305
00:32:21,564 --> 00:32:24,150
I'm afraid you must 
beat me first.

306
00:32:26,152 --> 00:32:28,279
You don't know anything, do you?

307
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:31,199
Do you think I ran in 
here to escape you?

308
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:32,784
No, I don't.

309
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:35,495
I have lots of questions for 
you, but no time to ask them.

310
00:32:35,787 --> 00:32:39,540
No, just one thing. Tell 
me, is Himuro Genma alive?

311
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,417
So what if he is?

312
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,087
I ask because I sent 
him to Hell before.

313
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:46,881
Is that so? Then I'll 
have to be careful.

314
00:32:47,006 --> 00:32:51,469
Unlike Genma, I don't have the 
technique to reincarnate myself.

315
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,096
Reincarnation?

316
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,190
Fool! You've damaged the hive!

317
00:33:21,040 --> 00:33:23,793
The second you come up for 
air is the second you die!

318
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,924
He's mine! Keep 
your hands off him!

319
00:33:30,216 --> 00:33:31,968
What about the 
Kunoichi and the monk?

320
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:35,763
My bees should finish 
them off soon.

321
00:33:45,273 --> 00:33:48,985
How far is he trying to run? 
What a poor loser!

322
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,627
Do you think he's fallen 
victim to the throat needle?

323
00:34:17,305 --> 00:34:21,934
No... The bees in the hive are 
trying to escape the water.

324
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:26,272
Desperately stinging his body as 
they do so... Mushizo's lost.

325
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,495
Took his time about it, but 
he finally killed him.

326
00:34:54,926 --> 00:35:00,515
Reincarnation? Did he mean Himuro 
Genma's come back to life?

327
00:35:01,557 --> 00:35:03,351
Impossible!

328
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:20,159
Reincarnation? I've heard 
about the technique.

329
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:26,541
You must control your flesh and 
blood down to the tiniest bones.

330
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:32,463
If your limbs or even your head were 
cut off, you'd be able to rejoin them.

331
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,175
Reincarnation... That's a 
technique of immortality.

332
00:35:36,175 --> 00:35:38,302
It can never be achieved 
by a human being.

333
00:35:38,719 --> 00:35:41,430
Well, well... That's 
a hell of a trick!

334
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:45,893
Anyway, the Kimon monsters 
are now all after you.

335
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:48,187
That means I can move easily.

336
00:35:51,149 --> 00:35:53,568
If you're lucky, 
we'll meet again.

337
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,781
Why did you join him?

338
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,577
He hired me... For 100 ryo.

339
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:05,663
You're a mercenary ninja? One 
who'd do anything for money?

340
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,416
You could say that.

341
00:36:08,416 --> 00:36:12,461
But he suckered me into it. 
Trapped me.

342
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:15,923
I'll die of his 
poison in half a day.

343
00:36:17,216 --> 00:36:21,053
He promised me an antidote 
along with the gold.

344
00:36:21,053 --> 00:36:25,183
That's why I work for him. 
I can't back out now.

345
00:36:25,516 --> 00:36:28,603
You'd better run for it while 
I divert their attention.

346
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:32,440
I can't do that. I'd 
owe you another debt.

347
00:36:32,899 --> 00:36:34,400
Forget about any debts.

348
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:37,778
And I told you I don't have 
to take orders from you.

349
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,323
Besides, I'm ready 
to die any moment.

350
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,366
Relax. Stop pretending 
you're so tough.

351
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:43,618
What?!

352
00:36:45,077 --> 00:36:47,413
It's this humid weather!

353
00:36:47,413 --> 00:36:51,876
I wish a storm would come and 
cool off that hot head of yours.

354
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:58,090
You're in no position 
to worry about me.

355
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:05,890
Storm...

356
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:12,146
They came on the night 
of that big storm...

357
00:37:16,734 --> 00:37:19,612
Hey, where can I get a 
good look at this area?

358
00:37:26,202 --> 00:37:27,578
How about there?

359
00:37:27,578 --> 00:37:28,829
Nothing.

360
00:37:28,829 --> 00:37:30,498
Keep looking !

361
00:37:43,469 --> 00:37:44,470
Hanza...

362
00:37:44,470 --> 00:37:45,179
Wait!

363
00:37:46,263 --> 00:37:46,973
Hanza!

364
00:37:51,936 --> 00:37:54,605
There's a cliff in front of you! 
Stop!

365
00:37:55,564 --> 00:37:56,649
Damn!

366
00:38:10,663 --> 00:38:11,789
Gotcha!

367
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:12,290
Shit!

368
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:24,969
Fool! They got you so soon? 
We still had a lot to do.

369
00:38:30,308 --> 00:38:33,310
The scent of blasted flesh, 
grilled to perfection...

370
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:35,229
Such a lovely smell.

371
00:38:59,962 --> 00:39:01,339
Don't... move...

372
00:39:01,630 --> 00:39:03,799
That's enough. Let me go.

373
00:39:03,799 --> 00:39:05,843
It's my fault I fell 
for their trap.

374
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:07,887
Shut up! Don't talk!

375
00:39:08,888 --> 00:39:11,182
Let go of me! I don't 
want your help.

376
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,142
Shut up!

377
00:39:21,275 --> 00:39:23,986
Go on, grab it!

378
00:39:50,054 --> 00:39:54,934
I am Utsutsu Mujuro. I've been 
longing to challenge you.

379
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,859
He's here for me. Stay here.

380
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:21,043
You lured me here because I'm blind? 
Is that your plan?

381
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:38,102
If you want to kill me, 
then don't make a sound.

382
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:43,107
That's impossible. But maybe I can 
turn your skill to my advantage.

383
00:41:18,392 --> 00:41:19,894
I told you to stay back!

384
00:41:26,817 --> 00:41:29,069
Your sight is your weakness.

385
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:33,491
Outta the way!

386
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,046
Impossible...

387
00:42:32,216 --> 00:42:35,511
The cargo from the ship that ran 
aground in the storm two days ago.

388
00:42:35,511 --> 00:42:37,638
That's what they're after.

389
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,975
They butchered the villagers 
like animals for it.

390
00:42:54,655 --> 00:42:56,824
Where does this road lead?

391
00:43:01,996 --> 00:43:03,080
Chamberlain!

392
00:43:04,832 --> 00:43:06,250
Lord Hyobu, is it true?

393
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:11,797
That the Koga ninja who went to investigate 
Shimoda Village were wiped out?

394
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,382
Exactly.

395
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:17,219
But how?! This is an emergency.

396
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:19,513
I'll take my men to the 
village immediately.

397
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:20,848
No!

398
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,059
If this is serious 
enough to jeopardize the

399
00:43:24,059 --> 00:43:27,605
safety of our clan, we 
must move very carefully.

400
00:43:28,355 --> 00:43:30,774
That's how small clans 
like ours survive.

401
00:43:30,774 --> 00:43:31,817
But...

402
00:43:32,151 --> 00:43:35,613
The Kunoichi who survived is 
continuing the investigation.

403
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,656
Wait for her report.

404
00:44:37,758 --> 00:44:41,553
Those wheel tracks lead 
to Kashima Harbor.

405
00:44:41,553 --> 00:44:44,098
They're probably going to 
transport the cargo out by boat.

406
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:44,973
If I don't stop them...

407
00:44:44,973 --> 00:44:48,894
those dead villagers and the Koga 
ninja will never rest in peace.

408
00:44:55,442 --> 00:44:59,488
Listen well, you who labor 
for the Shogun of the Dark.

409
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:03,033
This mission could very 
well decide our fate!

410
00:45:03,325 --> 00:45:06,412
This ship will reach 
Mochizuki in a few hours.

411
00:45:06,412 --> 00:45:09,540
We must retrieve the 
cargo at any cost!

412
00:45:09,832 --> 00:45:12,167
Understood? At any cost!

413
00:45:31,937 --> 00:45:34,523
The towns must have cleared out 
out of fear of the epidemic.

414
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:38,277
One horse was enough to 
scare them all away.

415
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:46,201
So, you're still alive. 
I've been worried.

416
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:49,204
It's nice to see you, too.

417
00:45:49,455 --> 00:45:52,750
They're waiting for a boat 
to transport the cargo.

418
00:45:53,292 --> 00:45:55,252
Did you check what the cargo is?

419
00:45:55,377 --> 00:46:00,132
No, I couldn't reach it. But 
I can guess what it is.

420
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:02,217
Actually, I guessed before 
I came to Mochizuki.

421
00:46:02,759 --> 00:46:03,761
What?!

422
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:05,888
You haven't figured it out?

423
00:46:05,095 --> 00:46:08,432
It's something that has 
to do with your past.

424
00:46:09,349 --> 00:46:10,434
It's gold, boy.

425
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:15,063
Gold produced from that 
secret Yamashiro mine.

426
00:46:16,982 --> 00:46:19,151
The ship ran aground 
during the storm...

427
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:23,322
Probably on its way to the Shogun 
of the Dark with caskets of gold.

428
00:46:23,489 --> 00:46:27,826
Gold that's probably been 
hidden for the last five years.

429
00:46:28,076 --> 00:46:30,287
If it reaches his hands,

430
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:32,956
he'll be powerful enough to 
topple the Tokugawa government...

431
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:35,125
...and plunge the country 
into another civil war.

432
00:46:35,334 --> 00:46:37,377
We have to stop it at any cost!

433
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:44,426
Dakuan, you've got a tail.

434
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:45,177
What?!

435
00:46:55,729 --> 00:46:57,606
Kunoichi, what are you doing?!

436
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,360
I'm calling a Koga ninja 
bird that's in this village.

437
00:47:01,985 --> 00:47:03,445
Calling a bird? What for?

438
00:47:03,946 --> 00:47:06,532
It'll carry my message to 
the castle chamberlain.

439
00:47:06,782 --> 00:47:08,784
I've discovered 
what they're after.

440
00:47:08,784 --> 00:47:12,579
Ln two hours, his army 
will surround the town.

441
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,581
It's not as easy as you think.

442
00:47:14,915 --> 00:47:18,043
The Mochizuki clan will probably 
ignore this whole thing.

443
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:19,044
Why?!

444
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,634
The future of the 
clan is at stake.

445
00:47:25,634 --> 00:47:28,720
This is a power struggle between the 
Tokugawa and the Shogun of the Dark.

446
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,933
If a small clan like the Mochizuki 
got involved, it'd be smashed !

447
00:47:36,061 --> 00:47:39,606
See nothing, hear nothing. That's 
the best course for the clan.

448
00:47:51,326 --> 00:47:53,870
We'll find out soon whether or 
not the Mochizuki will move.

449
00:48:15,559 --> 00:48:16,435
Shit!

450
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:18,186
Uh-oh!

451
00:48:32,534 --> 00:48:33,744
Kunoichi in Custody

452
00:48:33,744 --> 00:48:38,498
Kunoichi in Custody It must have 
happened when I went off for a moment.

453
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:39,374
Kunoichi in Custody

454
00:48:39,833 --> 00:48:42,794
She's most likely dead.

455
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:46,715
Well, we've got work to do.

456
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,176
We'll get no help from 
the Mochizuki clan.

457
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:55,140
Don't fall for their trap.

458
00:48:55,557 --> 00:48:56,391
Wait!

459
00:48:57,726 --> 00:49:00,312
What if their ship comes 
while you're at it?

460
00:49:00,312 --> 00:49:03,815
Let her alone! A dead Kunoichi 
isn't that important!

461
00:49:04,816 --> 00:49:06,693
Not important compared 
to the great mission?

462
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,695
You're as much of a 
monster as they are!

463
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:13,325
Fool! When you fight monsters, you 
become one yourself or you can't win!

464
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:19,331
You damn fool boy! Go ahead ! 
GO TO HELL!

465
00:49:19,331 --> 00:49:22,668
Damn you... !

466
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:06,878
Are you all right?

467
00:50:09,464 --> 00:50:10,173
Kagero!

468
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:33,196
You're hard to kill, but... 
Woman, release his pain.

469
00:50:56,219 --> 00:50:58,555
Kibagami Jubei?

470
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:01,892
Yes. But we've already 
killed them all.

471
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,644
Idiot! They still live.

472
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,397
I'll kill him, for sure!

473
00:51:07,397 --> 00:51:11,860
Stay where you are. Lure 
them there and kill them.

474
00:51:12,152 --> 00:51:13,403
Understand?

475
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:13,862
Yes.

476
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:22,537
Never would I have 
imagined to see him here.

477
00:51:22,746 --> 00:51:25,290
I look forward to seeing 
you again, Jubei.

478
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:28,543
Genma!

479
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,925
I'm sorry.

480
00:51:35,842 --> 00:51:39,888
Forget it. I take it the castle 
retainers haven't taken any action?

481
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:43,767
It's been two hours.

482
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:45,769
I see.

483
00:51:49,689 --> 00:51:53,401
Why... You knew it was a trap, 
but you came to help me.

484
00:51:53,401 --> 00:51:56,822
It was stupid. Why 
risk your life for me?

485
00:51:56,822 --> 00:51:58,782
Because I can't just 
toss aside my comrade.

486
00:51:58,907 --> 00:51:59,658
Comrade?

487
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:04,538
Yes. We've saved each other 
over and over since yesterday.

488
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,914
You're a precious friend to me.

489
00:52:15,173 --> 00:52:15,924
Stay!

490
00:52:16,466 --> 00:52:19,094
The Mochizuki clan is 
staying out of this one.

491
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:20,929
Your mission is over.

492
00:52:21,304 --> 00:52:24,683
No, it isn't. I'm 
still in debt to you.

493
00:52:26,434 --> 00:52:28,019
You can pay it back later.

494
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:31,106
Not if you're dead !

495
00:52:31,231 --> 00:52:33,024
I'll repay it here!

496
00:52:43,076 --> 00:52:44,786
What are you doing?

497
00:52:50,959 --> 00:52:54,421
The old man told me how 
to counteract the poison.

498
00:52:55,714 --> 00:52:57,507
"Kill poison with poison."

499
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:02,178
He said if you make love to a 
poison-taster like me, you'll be cured.

500
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:06,391
Take me...

501
00:54:02,656 --> 00:54:05,784
We've been waiting ! Load 
the ship immediately!

502
00:54:32,310 --> 00:54:35,605
You! Well, I warned 
you, didn't I?

503
00:54:35,605 --> 00:54:38,858
We've lost. We'll never 
beat that many men.

504
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:43,446
I don't intend to let them go. 
We'll make our stand soon.

505
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:45,573
What are you planning?

506
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:48,576
When they finish 
loading the gold...

507
00:54:48,576 --> 00:54:50,495
...go to the tower 
and ring the bell.

508
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:53,081
While they're distracted, 
I'll sneak onboard the ship.

509
00:54:54,249 --> 00:54:57,127
When we're out at sea, 
we won't need any storm.

510
00:54:57,127 --> 00:54:58,878
I'll sink it myself.

511
00:54:59,004 --> 00:54:59,879
Very well.

512
00:55:00,755 --> 00:55:04,467
By the way, did you make 
love to that Kunoichi?

513
00:55:06,011 --> 00:55:09,931
None of your damn business! 
Now get going !

514
00:55:32,162 --> 00:55:34,873
Genma... Where are you?

515
00:55:34,998 --> 00:55:38,251
When I die, I'll take 
you to hell with me!

516
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,993
The Mochizuki clan?! They're 
moving against them!

517
00:56:18,333 --> 00:56:20,460
Ah, Kunoichi! You've 
done a fine job.

518
00:56:20,835 --> 00:56:22,879
Hurry, before they get away! 
Where are the others?

519
00:56:24,381 --> 00:56:27,217
Don't worry. They've got 
this place surrounded.

520
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:29,636
Then hurry!

521
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,864
Jubei...

522
00:56:57,872 --> 00:56:59,457
Kagero!

523
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,335
Stop! It's a trap!

524
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:07,465
Fool! Sakaki Hyobu 
died two days ago.

525
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,356
I killed him personally.

526
00:57:23,857 --> 00:57:26,609
Genma!

527
00:57:50,091 --> 00:57:53,511
Sir, please get aboard 
the ship quickly.

528
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:57,098
The retainers of the Shogun 
of the Dark are waiting.

529
00:57:57,932 --> 00:58:02,145
Leave Jubei to me. Upon my 
honor, I will not fail.

530
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:06,441
Please grant me this one wish.

531
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:12,530
Very well then. Go.

532
00:58:40,517 --> 00:58:44,479
Stay out of this. Don't shame me 
any more than you already have.

533
00:58:46,981 --> 00:58:48,608
So, you are Genma?

534
00:58:49,150 --> 00:58:52,654
The Mochizuki clan 
suspects nothing, correct?

535
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,656
Yes. All is well.

536
00:58:54,656 --> 00:58:59,077
You've done a splendid job. I 
admire you Devils of Kimon.

537
00:58:59,160 --> 00:59:02,205
The Shogun of the 
Dark will be pleased.

538
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,407
Writhe in pain before you die.

539
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,362
Yurimaru seems to have 
suffered some ill fortune!

540
01:00:16,362 --> 01:00:18,823
How careless of him to 
have fallen into my trap.

541
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:23,661
It was your own fault, Yurimaru.

542
01:00:27,415 --> 01:00:28,458
Let's go.

543
01:00:31,544 --> 01:00:32,545
Kagero!

544
01:00:42,388 --> 01:00:44,557
Hang on! Kagero!

545
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,729
Jubei...

546
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:51,564
I told you not to come.

547
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:56,736
I wanted... to apologize...

548
01:01:00,239 --> 01:01:02,658
It was the first time...

549
01:01:02,658 --> 01:01:06,412
You didn't treat me like 
some poison-taster...

550
01:01:06,412 --> 01:01:09,582
...but like a normal woman.

551
01:02:01,801 --> 01:02:07,473
Jubei... I'm glad... 
I met you...

552
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:47,490
Genma, with the gold's help our 
dream will soon be reality.

553
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:48,533
"Our" dream?

554
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:54,455
Our great dream to topple the Shogunate 
and restore the reign of the Toyotomi.

555
01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:56,582
You don't understand...

556
01:03:56,582 --> 01:04:00,169
How we, the former retainers 
of Toyotomi, have suffered.

557
01:04:00,503 --> 01:04:04,090
Now it'll be the Tokugawa who 
suffer the agony and torment.

558
01:04:04,090 --> 01:04:09,887
We'll use the gold to buy advanced weapons 
from Spain and defeat the Tokugawa.

559
01:04:09,887 --> 01:04:14,392
That is the dream of all of us who 
work for the Shogun of the Dark.

560
01:04:15,226 --> 01:04:16,394
Nonsense.

561
01:04:18,104 --> 01:04:19,355
What did you say?!

562
01:04:19,564 --> 01:04:21,315
I said nonsense.

563
01:04:21,315 --> 01:04:24,402
Hold your tongue! 
You're a mere ninja!

564
01:04:24,402 --> 01:04:26,362
My dream is different.

565
01:04:26,362 --> 01:04:29,323
The gold isn't going to 
the Shogun of the Dark.

566
01:04:29,323 --> 01:04:30,074
What?!

567
01:04:30,074 --> 01:04:32,285
We, the Devils of Kimon, 
will take the gold.

568
01:04:32,410 --> 01:04:33,953
You impudent... !

569
01:04:35,955 --> 01:04:40,293
I'll use it to organize the most 
powerful army of ninja ever.

570
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:44,922
And we'll rule the country with 
terror and power from the shadows.

571
01:04:45,214 --> 01:04:48,175
Anyone who opposes me, 
Tokugawa or Toyotomi...

572
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:51,220
...even the Shogun of the 
Dark himself, shall die.

573
01:04:52,638 --> 01:04:56,809
Meaning the true Shogun of the Dark... 
will be me.

574
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:20,124
Well now, you're here! I was 
just wishing you'd come.

575
01:05:20,124 --> 01:05:21,208
I'm glad to hear that.

576
01:05:21,709 --> 01:05:23,377
Of course.

577
01:05:23,377 --> 01:05:28,883
Without your help, sinking a big 
ship like this would be impossible!

578
01:05:35,264 --> 01:05:36,349
Pathetic old fool!

579
01:05:37,975 --> 01:05:38,851
Over here.

580
01:05:49,528 --> 01:05:50,488
What's wrong?

581
01:05:51,322 --> 01:05:54,367
Fire in the hold ! 
We're gonna sink!

582
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:56,202
Idiot! Put out the fire!

583
01:05:56,327 --> 01:05:58,412
Impossible! It's a sea of flame!

584
01:05:58,537 --> 01:06:01,165
Put it out! Fight it!

585
01:06:01,290 --> 01:06:03,292
Move it! Move it!

586
01:06:03,668 --> 01:06:05,127
Forget it! Run!

587
01:06:14,053 --> 01:06:14,804
Master Genma!

588
01:06:15,971 --> 01:06:17,431
Pass this message to everyone:

589
01:06:17,556 --> 01:06:22,728
"Abandon ship and hide yourselves. 
I'll call for you someday."

590
01:06:22,728 --> 01:06:23,729
Go.

591
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:03,436
Genma!

592
01:07:06,605 --> 01:07:09,692
I see you brought back some 
devils from your trip to Hell.

593
01:07:18,701 --> 01:07:20,536
Kibagami Jubei...

594
01:07:20,661 --> 01:07:23,080
I should've finished 
you with my own hands.

595
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,959
Stop your whining. 
It's too late.

596
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:32,339
You want to avenge 
the Kunoichi Kagero?

597
01:07:32,548 --> 01:07:35,760
She was trash in comparison 
to what I've lost.

598
01:07:39,805 --> 01:07:41,557
You alone I can't forgive!

599
01:08:32,233 --> 01:08:35,569
I won't kill you yet. Not 
before I make you suffer.

600
01:08:35,903 --> 01:08:38,155
I'll make you pay for 
smashing my dream.

601
01:08:38,364 --> 01:08:43,160
Your dream? That you were going to 
be the true Shogun of the Dark?

602
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:45,579
Don't make me laugh.

603
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:51,126
If you became shogun, you'd 
make this a world of devils.

604
01:08:51,794 --> 01:08:56,549
If you enjoy their company so much... 
then go back to hell!

605
01:09:13,774 --> 01:09:15,359
I'll kill you!

606
01:09:18,696 --> 01:09:20,781
No one can kill me.

607
01:09:25,202 --> 01:09:28,080
You of all people 
should know by now...

608
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:33,836
I am immortal.

609
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:38,382
Is that so?

610
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:53,188
If you keep coming 
back to life...

611
01:09:53,731 --> 01:09:57,484
...then I'll kill you as 
many times as it takes!

612
01:11:09,348 --> 01:11:10,891
You fool!

613
01:11:56,270 --> 01:11:59,356
Genma! HERE YOU DIE!

614
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,166
Jubei!

615
01:12:59,166 --> 01:13:03,545
You seem to be rid of the 
poison, thanks to Kagero.

616
01:13:03,712 --> 01:13:08,133
The combination of a poison-tasting 
Kunoichi and a talented lone wolf

617
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:10,469
worked out even better 
than I had planned.

618
01:13:10,677 --> 01:13:12,054
Go away.

619
01:13:16,642 --> 01:13:21,355
By the way, I'm sorry about losing Kagero. 
A real pity, that!

620
01:13:21,438 --> 01:13:24,691
But for a scant few 
moments, she was able to

621
01:13:24,691 --> 01:13:27,861
be an ordinary girl and 
make love with you.

622
01:13:28,695 --> 01:13:30,697
Was that part of your plan, too?

623
01:13:30,697 --> 01:13:35,869
Exactly. To read and control peoples' 
hearts is the true secret of the ninja.

624
01:13:37,538 --> 01:13:42,167
Still, only true sincerity 
can move the human heart.

625
01:13:42,167 --> 01:13:45,045
A twisted old bastard 
like me couldn't do it.

626
01:13:45,170 --> 01:13:48,924
You're a hell of a guy. 
I really admire you.

627
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,927
As promised, I'll be waiting 
in Edo with your 100 ryo.

628
01:13:51,927 --> 01:13:53,846
Come and get it, if 
you're still alive.

629
01:14:00,686 --> 01:14:04,189
That makes us even. Now 
never cross my path again.

630
01:14:05,190 --> 01:14:08,902
You've beaten me. I thought I'd 
shut your mouth in Edo, but...

631
01:14:08,902 --> 01:14:12,948
Still, in your condition you likely 
won't even make it to the shore.

632
01:14:12,948 --> 01:14:15,659
Everything will end 
just as I planned.
