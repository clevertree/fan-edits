1
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:58,641
We lost 300 ryo, thanks 
to your meddling.

2
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,436
We won't go back empty-handed.

3
00:01:01,603 --> 00:01:04,898
If your hands are so 
empty, will you hold this?

4
00:01:33,176 --> 00:01:36,304
Is it true they hired you 
for only twenty ryo?

5
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,388
Yes.

6
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:42,268
The sword we stole was a treasure 
given to them by the Shogun.

7
00:01:42,393 --> 00:01:46,397
And they'll only pay 
twenty to get it back?

8
00:01:48,358 --> 00:01:49,317
Ridiculous!

9
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:51,736
They're a poor, small clan.

10
00:01:51,861 --> 00:01:55,406
Trying to swindle 300 ryo for 
a sword is asking too much.

11
00:01:57,325 --> 00:01:59,410
Shut up! Damn you!

12
00:02:02,831 --> 00:02:05,208
Looks like a nasty 
storm's brewing...

13
00:02:05,375 --> 00:02:07,043
Can't waste my time here!

14
00:02:09,337 --> 00:02:14,342
Ninja Scroll

15
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,910
Oh, I'm sorry for you.

16
00:03:22,285 --> 00:03:24,162
That was one hell of a storm!

17
00:03:24,162 --> 00:03:27,165
That's right! My roof got blown 
off and scared my wife so bad...

18
00:03:27,165 --> 00:03:28,958
...that she went into labor.

19
00:03:29,083 --> 00:03:30,627
It was really something.

20
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:33,004
That's your seventh kid, right?

21
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,505
Nope, the ninth.

22
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,634
Whoa! You must really 
love your wife!

23
00:03:39,427 --> 00:03:43,222
Isn't that Sakichi's daughter 
from Shimoda Village?

24
00:03:44,265 --> 00:03:46,225
What's with her?

25
00:03:51,856 --> 00:03:53,232
What's wrong?!

26
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,241
All... dead...

27
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:05,078
Everybody's dead.

28
00:04:05,662 --> 00:04:07,455
Dead?!

29
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,709
Plague... Plague did it...

30
00:04:17,048 --> 00:04:18,675
My god !

31
00:04:19,133 --> 00:04:22,136
This area's off limits! 
No one goes through!

32
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:25,807
This road's closed until 
the epidemic is over.

33
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:28,184
Epidemic?! The hell with that!

34
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:31,729
What is it?

35
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:35,525
Sir, my scout saw a 
strange group of men

36
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:39,696
ride toward Shimoda 
Village late last night.

37
00:04:40,863 --> 00:04:43,157
It might have something 
to do with this

38
00:04:43,157 --> 00:04:45,660
epidemic so I came to 
tell you, Chamberlain.

39
00:04:45,702 --> 00:04:51,291
Meaning what? That they spread a plague 
as they passed through the village?

40
00:04:51,416 --> 00:04:53,876
Ridiculous! Why 
would they do that?

41
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:56,379
Something's fishy.

42
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:58,339
Let it alone.

43
00:05:02,427 --> 00:05:04,262
On second thought, we can't.

44
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:06,764
This is the order to 
all of you Koga ninja.

45
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:09,851
Go to Shimoda Village and 
find what really happened.

46
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:10,893
Sir!

47
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:14,188
One more thing. If any of 
your people get infected...

48
00:05:15,231 --> 00:05:16,816
Understood, sir.

49
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,819
The first group will follow the 
Shirakawa River from the north.

50
00:05:20,278 --> 00:05:23,197
The second will cross 
Taro Pass from the west.

51
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:26,200
You'll reach Shimoda Village 
in about an hour. Understand?

52
00:05:26,743 --> 00:05:30,872
Hikoza saw them. There were only eight. 
No match for us.

53
00:05:32,165 --> 00:05:33,875
Our real enemy is this epidemic.

54
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,627
True.

55
00:05:47,430 --> 00:05:48,389
Kagero...

56
00:05:56,522 --> 00:05:59,067
You intend to leave 
me behind, Hanza?

57
00:05:59,817 --> 00:06:02,862
You have your own 
duties, don't you?

58
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:06,115
Poison tasting is very important. 
Don't forget that.

59
00:06:06,783 --> 00:06:11,079
While our lord is away from his 
domain, the work isn't necessary.

60
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,706
Until he returns...

61
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,083
I am one of the Koga ninja!

62
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:18,086
I cannot take you.

63
00:06:18,544 --> 00:06:21,089
You could all be 
killed out there.

64
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:25,426
How can I just sit and 
wait here alone?!

65
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:45,905
Kagero's gotten even 
more beautiful.

66
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,116
All the more reason to pity her.

67
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,701
It's her destiny. 
She must hate it.

68
00:06:51,327 --> 00:06:54,330
Enough. Where are 
Hikoza and the others?

69
00:06:54,330 --> 00:06:57,291
They were right behind us. 
I'll have a look.

70
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:14,433
Hey! What are you doing?

71
00:07:18,521 --> 00:07:20,022
What the...?!

72
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,426
There!

73
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:11,282
Shit!

74
00:08:21,459 --> 00:08:22,793
Tessai!

75
00:08:27,673 --> 00:08:29,342
You are indeed a sorry sight.

76
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,345
Shall we go?

77
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,568
Who was that freak?

78
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,364
Forget it. I don't want 
to see him again, anyway.

79
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:56,619
I'm grateful to you. I am 
Kagero of the Koga ninja.

80
00:08:57,954 --> 00:09:01,290
Jubei. Kibagami Jubei.

81
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:05,670
The town of Kakio is to the west. 
Our paths part here.

82
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:57,513
Oh, hi...

83
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:02,184
I know the way now, so...

84
00:10:05,563 --> 00:10:07,106
Ow...

85
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:10,693
Okay, I got it. Are we done now?

86
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:15,031
There's no reason we 
should kill each other.

87
00:10:19,327 --> 00:10:21,120
If you're not going to end this... 
I will!

88
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,165
Like hell!

89
00:10:34,216 --> 00:10:38,387
Strange skill you have. But 
it can't hurt my body.

90
00:10:40,097 --> 00:10:41,057
Seems that way.

91
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:59,408
What's wrong, Monster? Your 
skin's starting to crumble!

92
00:11:02,578 --> 00:11:03,871
Die!

93
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,773
Splendid !

94
00:11:30,773 --> 00:11:34,235
Your sword flew swift 
as the wind itself and

95
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:37,571
slashed your enemy like 
a cyclone's touch.

96
00:11:38,864 --> 00:11:42,618
He was no match for you. 
Why don't you join me?

97
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:47,456
Your skills will be of great help 
for me to fight the likes of him.

98
00:11:48,082 --> 00:11:52,628
You're joking. Who'd want to 
fight a monster like him again?

99
00:11:53,671 --> 00:11:56,632
You'll have to. They 
won't leave you alone.

100
00:11:56,632 --> 00:12:00,719
You just killed one of the 
Eight Devils of Kimon.

101
00:12:02,263 --> 00:12:06,267
You didn't beat him 
by yourself, though.

102
00:12:07,685 --> 00:12:12,189
That Koga ninja woman... 
Interesting technique she uses.

103
00:12:28,956 --> 00:12:32,668
Lord Genma. All is 
proceeding as planned.

104
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:43,429
It arrives from the Shogun of the 
Dark by six tomorrow evening.

105
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:48,809
Very well. Write 
to him in return.

106
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:55,357
"We return in three days. There's 
nothing to worry about."

107
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:56,942
At once.

108
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:45,407
Where are you headed?

109
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,370
No place in particular. You?

110
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:56,043
I'm looking for somebody, and you 
look exactly like him, so...

111
00:13:56,752 --> 00:14:00,756
Strangers can look alike. I'm 
Kibagami Jubei, a wanderer...

112
00:14:13,227 --> 00:14:15,062
It was most certainly your face.

113
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:19,316
Tessai was able to make 
an impression of it.

114
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,793
Just leave me the hell alone!

115
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:48,762
A cast-off skin.

116
00:14:48,762 --> 00:14:52,224
She shed it like a 
snake and escaped.

117
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,979
A gang of freaks, one and all.

118
00:14:59,189 --> 00:15:03,652
You've no obligation. I just 
didn't want you to die yet.

119
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,947
Who are these Eight 
Devils of Kimon?

120
00:15:07,906 --> 00:15:10,075
A group of ninja who work 
for the Shogun of the Dark.

121
00:15:10,075 --> 00:15:12,036
You know of the 
Shogun of the Dark?

122
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:15,122
He wants to rebuild the Toyotomi 
clan, the former rulers of Japan.

123
00:15:15,122 --> 00:15:19,460
He has 16 lords behind him and is 
trying to expand his influence.

124
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:22,630
The most dangerous enemy 
of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

125
00:15:22,963 --> 00:15:27,092
His power is supported in the 
shadows by the Eight Devils.

126
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:29,637
What are they up to 
here in Mochizuki?

127
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:34,016
That's what I came here to find out. 
It's a tough job.

128
00:15:35,517 --> 00:15:38,687
Why don't you work for 
me, for 100 ryo?

129
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:42,650
A Tokugawa spy wants 
to hire a ninja?

130
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:46,820
I'm afraid I have no choice. 
It's an emergency.

131
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:50,240
Only I managed to make 
it here to Mochizuki.

132
00:15:50,532 --> 00:15:53,118
The Eight Devils killed everyone 
else in my party on our way here.

133
00:15:53,118 --> 00:15:55,746
I need your help by all means!

134
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:59,750
You'll never get away from them.

135
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:02,086
You'll have to fight 
them sooner or later.

136
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,297
Join me. You can kill two 
birds with one stone, right?

137
00:16:05,881 --> 00:16:09,760
I don't think so. Now why don't 
you just leave me alone?

138
00:16:12,388 --> 00:16:14,723
I see. Too bad.

139
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:17,434
Such a pity...

140
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:24,525
You'll lose your precious life.

141
00:16:24,983 --> 00:16:26,110
You're stubborn.

142
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:30,197
No, what I speak of is literally of 
life or death importance to you.

143
00:16:30,197 --> 00:16:34,743
You see, that shuriken 
was poisoned.

144
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,287
It won't kill you instantly, 
but in a day and a

145
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:40,082
night, when it starts to 
work, nothing can stop it.

146
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:46,171
Unless you get the antidote. 
And only I know what it is.

147
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:49,007
Work for me and I'll tell 
you the antidote along

148
00:16:49,007 --> 00:16:51,468
with the hundred ryo 
when the job is done.

149
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,513
You're bluffing.

150
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:01,687
I speak the truth.

151
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:05,607
Tell me now. What's 
the antidote?

152
00:17:05,607 --> 00:17:09,820
Not until you work for me. Kill 
me and you've killed yourself!

153
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:17,494
Now you'll need the 
antidote for yourself.

154
00:17:17,995 --> 00:17:20,956
Poor boy... You've 
so much to learn.

155
00:17:20,956 --> 00:17:23,751
That isn't the one that hit you.

156
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:27,087
I threw THAT one away.

157
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:31,216
Shit!

158
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:36,805
Kibagami Jubei... You've lost... 
amateur!

159
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:41,560
My name is Dakuan. 
How do you do?

160
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,232
So, Benisato...

161
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:51,737
This man, Kibagami Jubei, is a 
remnant of the Shogunate's spies?

162
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:53,697
Possibly.

163
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:55,741
Why didn't you kill him?

164
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,493
Someone interfered.

165
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:58,744
No excuses!

166
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:06,085
If he's a government spy, 
he'll show up here soon.

167
00:18:06,376 --> 00:18:08,128
Be sure to kill him this time.

168
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,631
I don't need your 
advice to do that.

169
00:18:15,594 --> 00:18:17,137
Jubei...

170
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:21,517
There's something 
I've been wondering.

171
00:18:22,226 --> 00:18:25,354
Are you, by chance, the 
ninja who killed the chief

172
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:28,273
retainers of the Yamashiro 
clan five years ago?

173
00:18:29,191 --> 00:18:32,778
He was supposedly a master 
swordsman, like you.

174
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,700
The retainers had 
gorged themselves with

175
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:41,870
gold they secretly dug 
out of a hidden mine.

176
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:45,707
The ninja must have killed 
them by order of the lord

177
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,376
who wanted to report the 
mine to the government.

178
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:51,296
Because if the government found 
the hidden gold mine first...

179
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,215
the lord would have 
lost his fief.

180
00:18:53,924 --> 00:18:58,470
But does that ninja know that after 
the retainers were killed...

181
00:18:58,470 --> 00:19:01,056
the government received 
no report about the mine?

182
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,016
Why?

183
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:08,647
If a government spy like you knows all 
that, then why don't you do something?

184
00:19:09,398 --> 00:19:14,319
No... Even the government can't 
move without definite evidence.

185
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:17,447
Our spies tried many 
times to infiltrate the

186
00:19:17,447 --> 00:19:20,826
clan to find evidence, 
but none returned alive.

187
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,369
The Shogun of the Dark...

188
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:25,664
He stopped them by 
using the Kimon ninja.

189
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:29,751
Why is the Shogun of the Dark 
helping the Yamashiro clan?

190
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,214
Simple. He wants the 
gold mine for himself.

191
00:19:35,591 --> 00:19:40,596
Do you know how he found the 
mine before the government?

192
00:19:41,221 --> 00:19:43,765
Somebody gave him 
the information.

193
00:19:43,765 --> 00:19:47,352
Somebody who was the leader of 
the ninja of the Yamashiro clan.

194
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:50,314
Himuro... Genma?!

195
00:19:51,815 --> 00:19:53,317
Precisely.

196
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:57,988
I doubt that. He isn't 
in this world anymore.

197
00:19:58,572 --> 00:20:02,075
No, he's still very much alive. 
And you'll see him soon.

198
00:20:02,075 --> 00:20:05,329
Himuro Genma is the boss 
of the Kimon monsters.

199
00:20:05,329 --> 00:00:00,000


200
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:08,415
Shh! Not so loud !

201
00:20:08,415 --> 00:20:10,459
You can't trick me 
the same way again!

202
00:20:10,459 --> 00:20:14,713
Don't be hasty. You'll 
soon know the truth.

203
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:20,260
But you must admit that you 
and he share a strange fate.

204
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,644
Stop! You'd kill 
your own friend?!

205
00:20:28,644 --> 00:20:32,105
The lord orders it! 
As did our leader!

206
00:20:33,607 --> 00:20:35,150
It's a trick!

207
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,694
Now that we know the 
traitors' secret they want

208
00:20:37,694 --> 00:20:40,155
to get rid of us by making 
us kill each other.

209
00:20:40,572 --> 00:20:44,451
This is a trap for all of us. 
Shinkuro, believe me!

210
00:20:45,494 --> 00:20:47,162
Jubei... Forgive me.

211
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:48,747
Shinkuro!

212
00:20:49,706 --> 00:20:51,041
His word...

213
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:52,459
...is law!

214
00:21:31,748 --> 00:21:36,753
I avenged Shinkuro and the others myself. 
Genma can't be alive.

215
00:21:38,296 --> 00:21:42,342
We're getting close. This place 
is thick with ghosts and blood.

216
00:21:42,509 --> 00:21:44,970
Beyond lies Hell itself.

217
00:21:49,224 --> 00:21:53,228
Heaven must have sent 
this mist to help us.

218
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,619
Hey!

219
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,629
Double damned mist!

220
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:46,990
How could he have 
dodged Shijima's claw?

221
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,478
Who are you?

222
00:23:16,478 --> 00:23:19,898
I heard a voice 
chanting the sutra.

223
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:23,443
I was praying for 
the dead villagers.

224
00:23:24,444 --> 00:23:28,198
Don't you know an epidemic 
plagues this village?

225
00:23:29,741 --> 00:23:34,538
Poor soul! You'll never 
leave this village alive.

226
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:38,375
Here now, let us go to the 
land of Buddha together.

227
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:48,009
Have you seen a 
traveling monk here?

228
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:54,141
He'll meet Buddha soon enough. 
I'll send him there.

229
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:56,601
Such a benevolent nun...

230
00:24:05,068 --> 00:24:06,903
Shit! Another cast-off skin!

231
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:21,418
Gone... He uses a 
strange technique...

232
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,347
As do you. Very strange indeed !

233
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:50,363
Answer me. Are there any others 
with you besides the monk?

234
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:54,743
Of course. And not 
just ten or twenty.

235
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:57,120
You can send a snake for 
each and it won't be enough.

236
00:24:59,581 --> 00:25:00,832
Liar!

237
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:04,211
All right! I'll 
tell you the truth.

238
00:25:05,295 --> 00:25:09,007
There's two. One's the traveling monk. 
The other...

239
00:25:09,132 --> 00:25:10,467
...is right behind you.

240
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,764
Lose the snakes. Down 
to the last one!

241
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,230
You'll be dead soon.

242
00:25:27,776 --> 00:25:28,777
Get rid of them!

243
00:25:47,254 --> 00:25:49,589
Now it's your turn to answer.

244
00:25:49,589 --> 00:25:52,425
What are you doing in this village? 
Talk!

245
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:13,989
Twice failed. Unforgivable.

246
00:26:13,989 --> 00:26:17,993
I cast another line onto your 
neck, but you didn't notice.

247
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:20,745
Ln the end, just a 
foolish amateur.

248
00:26:39,472 --> 00:26:41,433
Idiot! There's still time 
to suck the poison out!

249
00:26:42,976 --> 00:26:45,854
Poison doesn't work on me. 
My body's immune to it.

250
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:51,109
I think I've cleared 
my debt to you.

251
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:53,820
Yes. You saved me.

252
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:58,325
Your name's Kagero, right? 
What are you going to do now?

253
00:26:58,325 --> 00:27:00,702
That's none of your concern.

254
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:03,788
If it isn't, then what the 
hell am I doing here?!

255
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:07,459
I have to discover their plan.

256
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:10,629
By yourself? Impossible!

257
00:27:10,629 --> 00:27:12,797
They're too strong. 
Think this over.

258
00:27:13,298 --> 00:27:15,008
Stay out of my way.

259
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:18,178
I've no reason to 
take orders from you.

260
00:27:21,848 --> 00:27:24,267
Hold a moment, Kunoichi of Koga.

261
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:29,189
My name is Dakuan. Why 
don't you join me?

262
00:27:29,189 --> 00:27:32,984
This man is my 
trustworthy assistant.

263
00:27:33,485 --> 00:27:35,987
I wasn't planning on 
helping a government spy.

264
00:27:35,987 --> 00:27:38,156
Oh, quit complaining !

265
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,532
What do you say, woman?

266
00:27:39,741 --> 00:27:44,204
Our aims may differ, but we 
three share a common enemy.

267
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:47,165
And three is mightier than one.

268
00:27:47,165 --> 00:27:50,585
And I happen to have some 
information you don't know.

269
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,630
Such as who is giving 
them their orders.

270
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:55,715
I'll tell you on the way.

271
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:00,845
I need no friends.

272
00:28:01,471 --> 00:28:05,350
But I may need your information.

273
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:06,893
Very well.

274
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:17,737
My, she's a lovely, sexy 
little thing, isn't she!

275
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:21,032
What's running through that 
twisted skull of yours?

276
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:25,245
Well now, that Kunoichi 
could prove very useful.

277
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:29,040
She has a technique to poison 
the man she sleeps with.

278
00:28:29,582 --> 00:28:34,379
The big guy you killed had 
been poisoned by her.

279
00:29:20,216 --> 00:29:22,927
Your skill is as 
marvelous as ever.

280
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:26,347
No... He was able to kill a 
mighty ninja like Tessai.

281
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:30,393
Don't be off guard. It's 
possible he got away.

282
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:33,229
The four of you 
will check it out.

283
00:29:33,229 --> 00:29:35,398
You're a cautious one, Yurimaru.

284
00:29:35,565 --> 00:29:40,653
We have an important mission. 
We take every precaution.

285
00:29:40,778 --> 00:29:42,614
I know, I know. Don't worry.

286
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:44,908
Then go.

287
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:51,080
Yurimaru, Benisato's death... 
How fortunate for you!

288
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:03,635
Only things he killed 
were the fish.

289
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:06,179
Good. Otherwise we 
wouldn't get our chance.

290
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:08,431
It's getting quite 
interesting, isn't it?

291
00:30:23,238 --> 00:30:26,407
How is it? Just as we thought?

292
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,286
They poisoned the wells 
and killed the villagers.

293
00:30:30,286 --> 00:30:32,372
And then blamed it on plague.

294
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:36,292
A trick to keep the 
villagers away.

295
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:41,965
They're planning something... 
quite extraordinary.

296
00:30:52,809 --> 00:30:55,353
I'd like to know what it is.

297
00:30:55,853 --> 00:30:58,898
That's fine, just don't get 
yourself involved too deeply.

298
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,608
It could prove fatal.

299
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:24,299
I see. Guide the others.

300
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:43,443
Run for it!

301
00:32:05,548 --> 00:32:07,508
We can't outrun them.

302
00:32:09,385 --> 00:32:10,553
Kagero...

303
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,574
So, the pollen is mixed 
with a sleeping potion.

304
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,493
But how long will 
it hold them back?

305
00:32:34,577 --> 00:32:35,954
Why, you!

306
00:32:36,746 --> 00:32:37,747
Girl!

307
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,291
You have to hold them off 
till Jubei kills him!

308
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,251
Do whatever it takes!

309
00:32:56,516 --> 00:32:58,267
Call off your bees!

310
00:32:59,394 --> 00:33:01,979
I'm afraid you must 
beat me first.

311
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,109
You don't know anything, do you?

312
00:33:06,109 --> 00:33:09,028
Do you think I ran in 
here to escape you?

313
00:33:09,612 --> 00:33:10,613
No, I don't.

314
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:13,324
I have lots of questions for 
you, but no time to ask them.

315
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:17,370
No, just one thing. Tell 
me, is Himuro Genma alive?

316
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,247
So what if he is?

317
00:33:19,247 --> 00:33:21,916
I ask because I sent 
him to Hell before.

318
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,711
Is that so? Then I'll 
have to be careful.

319
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:29,298
Unlike Genma, I don't have the 
technique to reincarnate myself.

320
00:33:29,632 --> 00:33:30,925
Reincarnation?

321
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,019
Fool! You've damaged the hive!

322
00:33:58,870 --> 00:34:01,622
The second you come up for 
air is the second you die!

323
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:07,754
He's mine! Keep 
your hands off him!

324
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:09,797
What about the 
Kunoichi and the monk?

325
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,593
My bees should finish 
them off soon.

326
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:26,814
How far is he trying to run? 
What a poor loser!

327
00:34:41,662 --> 00:34:44,457
Do you think he's fallen 
victim to the throat needle?

328
00:34:55,134 --> 00:34:59,764
No... The bees in the hive are 
trying to escape the water.

329
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:04,102
Desperately stinging his body as 
they do so... Mushizo's lost.

330
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,324
Took his time about it, but 
he finally killed him.

331
00:35:32,755 --> 00:35:38,344
Reincarnation? Did he mean Himuro 
Genma's come back to life?

332
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,180
Impossible!

333
00:35:54,068 --> 00:35:57,989
Reincarnation? I've heard 
about the technique.

334
00:35:59,115 --> 00:36:04,370
You must control your flesh and 
blood down to the tiniest bones.

335
00:36:04,495 --> 00:36:10,293
If your limbs or even your head were 
cut off, you'd be able to rejoin them.

336
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:14,005
Reincarnation... That's a 
technique of immortality.

337
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:16,132
It can never be achieved 
by a human being.

338
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,260
Well, well... That's 
a hell of a trick!

339
00:36:19,260 --> 00:36:23,723
Anyway, the Kimon monsters 
are now all after you.

340
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,017
That means I can move easily.

341
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:31,397
If you're lucky, 
we'll meet again.

342
00:36:34,275 --> 00:36:36,611
Why did you join him?

343
00:36:37,236 --> 00:36:40,406
He hired me... For 100 ryo.

344
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:43,492
You're a mercenary ninja? One 
who'd do anything for money?

345
00:36:44,368 --> 00:36:46,245
You could say that.

346
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:50,291
But he suckered me into it. 
Trapped me.

347
00:36:50,917 --> 00:36:53,753
I'll die of his 
poison in half a day.

348
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,883
He promised me an antidote 
along with the gold.

349
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:03,012
That's why I work for him. 
I can't back out now.

350
00:37:03,346 --> 00:37:06,432
You'd better run for it while 
I divert their attention.

351
00:37:07,099 --> 00:37:10,269
I can't do that. I'd 
owe you another debt.

352
00:37:10,728 --> 00:37:12,230
Forget about any debts.

353
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,608
And I told you I don't have 
to take orders from you.

354
00:37:15,608 --> 00:37:18,152
Besides, I'm ready 
to die any moment.

355
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,196
Relax. Stop pretending 
you're so tough.

356
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:21,447
What?!

357
00:37:22,907 --> 00:37:25,243
It's this humid weather!

358
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:29,705
I wish a storm would come and 
cool off that hot head of yours.

359
00:37:33,876 --> 00:37:35,920
You're in no position 
to worry about me.

360
00:37:42,468 --> 00:37:43,719
Storm...

361
00:37:45,763 --> 00:37:49,976
They came on the night 
of that big storm...

362
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:57,441
Hey, where can I get a 
good look at this area?

363
00:38:04,031 --> 00:38:05,408
How about there?

364
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:06,659
Nothing.

365
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:08,327
Keep looking !

366
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,299
Hanza...

367
00:38:22,299 --> 00:38:23,009
Wait!

368
00:38:24,093 --> 00:38:24,802
Hanza!

369
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:32,435
There's a cliff in front of you! 
Stop!

370
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,478
Damn!

371
00:38:48,492 --> 00:38:49,618
Gotcha!

372
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,119
Shit!

373
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:02,798
Fool! They got you so soon? 
We still had a lot to do.

374
00:39:08,137 --> 00:39:11,140
The scent of blasted flesh, 
grilled to perfection...

375
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:13,059
Such a lovely smell.

376
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,168
Don't... move...

377
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:41,629
That's enough. Let me go.

378
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,672
It's my fault I fell 
for their trap.

379
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:45,716
Shut up! Don't talk!

380
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:49,011
Let go of me! I don't 
want your help.

381
00:39:49,345 --> 00:39:50,971
Shut up!

382
00:39:59,105 --> 00:40:01,816
Go on, grab it!

383
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,206
Just gonna hang onto me all day?

384
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:39,019
I am Utsutsu Mujuro. I've been 
longing to challenge you.

385
00:40:45,526 --> 00:40:47,945
He's here for me. Stay here.

386
00:41:00,791 --> 00:41:05,129
You lured me here because I'm blind? 
Is that your plan?

387
00:41:19,602 --> 00:41:22,188
If you want to kill me, 
then don't make a sound.

388
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:27,193
That's impossible. But maybe I can 
turn your skill to my advantage.

389
00:42:02,478 --> 00:42:03,979
I told you to stay back!

390
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:13,155
Your sight is your weakness.

391
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:17,576
Outta the way!

392
00:42:30,172 --> 00:42:31,131
Impossible...

393
00:43:16,302 --> 00:43:19,596
The cargo from the ship that ran 
aground in the storm two days ago.

394
00:43:19,596 --> 00:43:21,724
That's what they're after.

395
00:43:21,724 --> 00:43:25,060
They butchered the villagers 
like animals for it.

396
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,909
Where does this road lead?

397
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,083
Chamberlain!

398
00:43:48,917 --> 00:43:50,336
Lord Hyobu, is it true?

399
00:43:50,336 --> 00:43:55,883
That the Koga ninja who went to investigate 
Shimoda Village were wiped out?

400
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:57,468
Exactly.

401
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:01,305
But how?! This is an emergency.

402
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:03,599
I'll take my men to the 
village immediately.

403
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:04,933
No!

404
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:08,145
If this is serious 
enough to jeopardize the

405
00:44:08,145 --> 00:44:11,690
safety of our clan, we 
must move very carefully.

406
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:14,860
That's how small clans 
like ours survive.

407
00:44:14,860 --> 00:44:15,903
But...

408
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:19,698
The Kunoichi who survived is 
continuing the investigation.

409
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,742
Wait for her report.

410
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:25,639
Those wheel tracks lead 
to Kashima Harbor.

411
00:45:25,639 --> 00:45:28,183
They're probably going to 
transport the cargo out by boat.

412
00:45:28,517 --> 00:45:29,059
If I don't stop them...

413
00:45:29,059 --> 00:45:32,980
those dead villagers and the Koga 
ninja will never rest in peace.

414
00:45:39,528 --> 00:45:43,574
Listen well, you who labor 
for the Shogun of the Dark.

415
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:47,119
This mission could very 
well decide our fate!

416
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:50,497
This ship will reach 
Mochizuki in a few hours.

417
00:45:50,497 --> 00:45:53,625
We must retrieve the 
cargo at any cost!

418
00:45:53,917 --> 00:45:56,253
Understood? At any cost!

419
00:46:16,023 --> 00:46:18,609
The towns must have cleared out 
out of fear of the epidemic.

420
00:46:19,443 --> 00:46:22,362
One horse was enough to 
scare them all away.

421
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:30,287
So, you're still alive. 
I've been worried.

422
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:33,290
It's nice to see you, too.

423
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:36,835
They're waiting for a boat 
to transport the cargo.

424
00:46:37,377 --> 00:46:39,338
Did you check what the cargo is?

425
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:44,218
No, I couldn't reach it. But 
I can guess what it is.

426
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:46,303
Actually, I guessed before 
I came to Mochizuki.

427
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:47,846
What?!

428
00:46:47,846 --> 00:46:49,973
You haven't figured it out?

429
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:52,518
It's something that has 
to do with your past.

430
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,437
It's gold, boy.

431
00:46:55,437 --> 00:46:59,149
Gold produced from that 
secret Yamashiro mine.

432
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,237
The ship ran aground 
during the storm...

433
00:47:03,237 --> 00:47:07,407
Probably on its way to the Shogun 
of the Dark with caskets of gold.

434
00:47:07,574 --> 00:47:11,912
Gold that's probably been 
hidden for the last five years.

435
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,373
If it reaches his hands,

436
00:47:14,373 --> 00:47:17,042
he'll be powerful enough to 
topple the Tokugawa government...

437
00:47:17,042 --> 00:47:19,211
...and plunge the country 
into another civil war.

438
00:47:19,419 --> 00:47:21,463
We have to stop it at any cost!

439
00:47:25,884 --> 00:47:28,512
Dakuan, you've got a tail.

440
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:29,263
What?!

441
00:47:39,815 --> 00:47:41,692
Kunoichi, what are you doing?!

442
00:47:42,025 --> 00:47:45,445
I'm calling a Koga ninja 
bird that's in this village.

443
00:47:46,071 --> 00:47:47,531
Calling a bird? What for?

444
00:47:48,031 --> 00:47:50,617
It'll carry my message to 
the castle chamberlain.

445
00:47:50,868 --> 00:47:52,870
I've discovered 
what they're after.

446
00:47:52,870 --> 00:47:56,665
Ln two hours, his army 
will surround the town.

447
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:58,667
It's not as easy as you think.

448
00:47:59,001 --> 00:48:02,129
The Mochizuki clan will probably 
ignore this whole thing.

449
00:48:02,588 --> 00:48:03,130
Why?!

450
00:48:07,884 --> 00:48:09,720
The future of the 
clan is at stake.

451
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,806
This is a power struggle between the 
Tokugawa and the Shogun of the Dark.

452
00:48:12,806 --> 00:48:17,019
If a small clan like the Mochizuki 
got involved, it'd be smashed !

453
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:23,692
See nothing, hear nothing. That's 
the best course for the clan.

454
00:48:35,412 --> 00:48:37,956
We'll find out soon whether or 
not the Mochizuki will move.

455
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:00,520
Shit!

456
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,272
Uh-oh!

457
00:49:22,793 --> 00:49:24,002
Kunoichi in Custody

458
00:49:24,002 --> 00:49:28,757
Kunoichi in Custody It must have 
happened when I went off for a moment.

459
00:49:28,757 --> 00:49:29,633
Kunoichi in Custody

460
00:49:30,092 --> 00:49:33,053
She's most likely dead.

461
00:49:33,929 --> 00:49:36,973
Well, we've got work to do.

462
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:39,434
We'll get no help from 
the Mochizuki clan.

463
00:49:43,021 --> 00:49:45,399
Don't fall for their trap.

464
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:46,650
Wait!

465
00:49:47,984 --> 00:49:50,570
What if their ship comes 
while you're at it?

466
00:49:50,570 --> 00:49:54,074
Let her alone! A dead Kunoichi 
isn't that important!

467
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:56,952
Not important compared 
to the great mission?

468
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,954
You're as much of a 
monster as they are!

469
00:49:58,954 --> 00:50:03,583
Fool! When you fight monsters, you 
become one yourself or you can't win!

470
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:09,589
You damn fool boy! Go ahead ! 
GO TO HELL!

471
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:12,926
Damn you... !

472
00:50:56,344 --> 00:50:57,137
Are you all right?

473
00:50:59,723 --> 00:51:00,432
Kagero!

474
00:51:19,576 --> 00:51:23,455
You're hard to kill, but... 
Woman, release his pain.

475
00:51:46,478 --> 00:51:48,814
Kibagami Jubei?

476
00:51:49,147 --> 00:51:52,150
Yes. But we've already 
killed them all.

477
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,903
Idiot! They still live.

478
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,656
I'll kill him, for sure!

479
00:51:57,656 --> 00:52:02,118
Stay where you are. Lure 
them there and kill them.

480
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:03,662
Understand?

481
00:52:03,662 --> 00:52:04,120
Yes.

482
00:52:10,335 --> 00:52:12,796
Never would I have 
imagined to see him here.

483
00:52:13,004 --> 00:52:15,549
I look forward to seeing 
you again, Jubei.

484
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,802
Genma!

485
00:52:23,849 --> 00:52:25,183
I'm sorry.

486
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:30,147
Forget it. I take it the castle 
retainers haven't taken any action?

487
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,025
It's been two hours.

488
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,027
I see.

489
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:43,660
Why... You knew it was a trap, 
but you came to help me.

490
00:52:43,660 --> 00:52:47,080
It was stupid. Why 
risk your life for me?

491
00:52:47,080 --> 00:52:49,040
Because I can't just 
toss aside my comrade.

492
00:52:49,165 --> 00:52:49,916
Comrade?

493
00:52:50,625 --> 00:52:54,796
Yes. We've saved each other 
over and over since yesterday.

494
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:56,173
You're a precious friend to me.

495
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:06,183
Stay!

496
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,352
The Mochizuki clan is 
staying out of this one.

497
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,187
Your mission is over.

498
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:14,941
No, it isn't. I'm 
still in debt to you.

499
00:53:16,693 --> 00:53:18,278
You can pay it back later.

500
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:21,364
Not if you're dead !

501
00:53:21,489 --> 00:53:23,283
I'll repay it here!

502
00:53:33,335 --> 00:53:35,045
What are you doing?

503
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:44,679
The old man told me how 
to counteract the poison.

504
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:47,766
"Kill poison with poison."

505
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:52,437
He said if you make love to a 
poison-taster like me, you'll be cured.

506
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,650
Take me...

507
00:54:52,914 --> 00:54:55,750
We've been waiting ! Load 
the ship immediately!

508
00:55:22,569 --> 00:55:25,864
You! Well, I warned 
you, didn't I?

509
00:55:25,864 --> 00:55:29,117
We've lost. We'll never 
beat that many men.

510
00:55:29,617 --> 00:55:33,705
I don't intend to let them go. 
We'll make our stand soon.

511
00:55:34,581 --> 00:55:35,832
What are you planning?

512
00:55:35,999 --> 00:55:38,835
When they finish 
loading the gold...

513
00:55:38,835 --> 00:55:40,754
...go to the tower 
and ring the bell.

514
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:44,257
While they're distracted, 
I'll sneak onboard the ship.

515
00:55:44,507 --> 00:55:47,385
When we're out at sea, 
we won't need any storm.

516
00:55:47,385 --> 00:55:49,137
I'll sink it myself.

517
00:55:49,262 --> 00:55:50,138
Very well.

518
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,726
By the way, did you make 
love to that Kunoichi?

519
00:55:56,269 --> 00:56:00,190
None of your damn business! 
Now get going !

520
00:56:22,420 --> 00:56:25,131
Genma... Where are you?

521
00:56:25,256 --> 00:56:28,510
When I die, I'll take 
you to hell with me!

522
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:03,169
The Mochizuki clan?! They're 
moving against them!

523
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,718
Ah, Kunoichi! You've 
done a fine job.

524
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:13,138
Hurry, before they get away! 
Where are the others?

525
00:57:14,639 --> 00:57:17,475
Don't worry. They've got 
this place surrounded.

526
00:57:18,017 --> 00:57:19,894
Then hurry!

527
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,123
Jubei...

528
00:57:48,131 --> 00:57:49,716
Kagero!

529
00:57:51,259 --> 00:57:52,594
Stop! It's a trap!

530
00:57:53,386 --> 00:57:57,724
Fool! Sakaki Hyobu 
died two days ago.

531
00:58:11,779 --> 00:58:13,615
I killed him personally.

532
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:16,868
Genma!

533
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,770
Sir, please get aboard 
the ship quickly.

534
00:58:43,770 --> 00:58:47,357
The retainers of the Shogun 
of the Dark are waiting.

535
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:52,403
Leave Jubei to me. Upon my 
honor, I will not fail.

536
00:58:53,363 --> 00:58:56,699
Please grant me this one wish.

537
00:59:00,995 --> 00:59:02,789
Very well then. Go.

538
00:59:30,775 --> 00:59:34,737
Stay out of this. Don't shame me 
any more than you already have.

539
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:38,866
So, you are Genma?

540
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:42,912
The Mochizuki clan 
suspects nothing, correct?

541
00:59:42,912 --> 00:59:44,914
Yes. All is well.

542
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:49,335
You've done a splendid job. I 
admire you Devils of Kimon.

543
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:52,463
The Shogun of the 
Dark will be pleased.

544
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:27,665
Writhe in pain before you die.

545
01:01:03,618 --> 01:01:06,621
Yurimaru seems to have 
suffered some ill fortune!

546
01:01:06,621 --> 01:01:09,082
How careless of him to 
have fallen into my trap.

547
01:01:11,459 --> 01:01:13,920
It was your own fault, Yurimaru.

548
01:01:17,673 --> 01:01:18,716
Let's go.

549
01:01:21,803 --> 01:01:22,804
Kagero!

550
01:01:32,647 --> 01:01:34,816
Hang on! Kagero!

551
01:01:38,694 --> 01:01:39,987
Jubei...

552
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,823
I told you not to come.

553
01:01:43,282 --> 01:01:46,994
I wanted... to apologize...

554
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:52,917
It was the first time...

555
01:01:52,917 --> 01:01:56,671
You didn't treat me like 
some poison-taster...

556
01:01:56,671 --> 01:01:59,841
...but like a normal woman.

557
01:02:52,059 --> 01:02:57,732
Jubei... I'm glad... 
I met you...

558
01:04:32,118 --> 01:04:37,748
Genma, with the gold's help our 
dream will soon be reality.

559
01:04:37,748 --> 01:04:38,791
"Our" dream?

560
01:04:38,791 --> 01:04:44,714
Our great dream to topple the Shogunate 
and restore the reign of the Toyotomi.

561
01:04:44,922 --> 01:04:46,841
You don't understand...

562
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,428
How we, the former retainers 
of Toyotomi, have suffered.

563
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:54,348
Now it'll be the Tokugawa who 
suffer the agony and torment.

564
01:04:54,348 --> 01:05:00,146
We'll use the gold to buy advanced weapons 
from Spain and defeat the Tokugawa.

565
01:05:00,146 --> 01:05:04,650
That is the dream of all of us who 
work for the Shogun of the Dark.

566
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:06,652
Nonsense.

567
01:05:08,362 --> 01:05:09,614
What did you say?!

568
01:05:09,822 --> 01:05:11,574
I said nonsense.

569
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:14,660
Hold your tongue! 
You're a mere ninja!

570
01:05:14,660 --> 01:05:16,621
My dream is different.

571
01:05:16,621 --> 01:05:19,582
The gold isn't going to 
the Shogun of the Dark.

572
01:05:19,582 --> 01:05:20,333
What?!

573
01:05:20,333 --> 01:05:22,543
We, the Devils of Kimon, 
will take the gold.

574
01:05:22,668 --> 01:05:24,211
You impudent... !

575
01:05:26,213 --> 01:05:30,551
I'll use it to organize the most 
powerful army of ninja ever.

576
01:05:30,551 --> 01:05:35,181
And we'll rule the country with 
terror and power from the shadows.

577
01:05:35,473 --> 01:05:38,434
Anyone who opposes me, 
Tokugawa or Toyotomi...

578
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,479
...even the Shogun of the 
Dark himself, shall die.

579
01:05:42,897 --> 01:05:47,068
Meaning the true Shogun of the Dark... 
will be me.

580
01:06:04,543 --> 01:06:10,383
Well now, you're here! I was 
just wishing you'd come.

581
01:06:10,383 --> 01:06:11,467
I'm glad to hear that.

582
01:06:11,968 --> 01:06:13,636
Of course.

583
01:06:13,636 --> 01:06:19,141
Without your help, sinking a big 
ship like this would be impossible!

584
01:06:25,523 --> 01:06:26,607
Pathetic old fool!

585
01:06:28,234 --> 01:06:29,110
Over here.

586
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:40,746
What's wrong?

587
01:06:41,580 --> 01:06:44,625
Fire in the hold ! 
We're gonna sink!

588
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,460
Idiot! Put out the fire!

589
01:06:46,585 --> 01:06:48,671
Impossible! It's a sea of flame!

590
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:51,424
Put it out! Fight it!

591
01:06:51,549 --> 01:06:53,551
Move it! Move it!

592
01:06:53,926 --> 01:06:55,386
Forget it! Run!

593
01:07:04,311 --> 01:07:05,062
Master Genma!

594
01:07:06,230 --> 01:07:07,690
Pass this message to everyone:

595
01:07:07,815 --> 01:07:12,987
"Abandon ship and hide yourselves. 
I'll call for you someday."

596
01:07:12,987 --> 01:07:13,988
Go.

597
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:54,612
Genma!

598
01:07:56,864 --> 01:07:59,950
I see you brought back some 
devils from your trip to Hell.

599
01:08:08,959 --> 01:08:10,795
Kibagami Jubei...

600
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:14,256
I should've finished 
you with my own hands.

601
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:17,218
Stop your whining. 
It's too late.

602
01:08:19,094 --> 01:08:22,598
You want to avenge 
the Kunoichi Kagero?

603
01:08:22,807 --> 01:08:26,018
She was trash in comparison 
to what I've lost.

604
01:08:30,064 --> 01:08:31,816
You alone I can't forgive!

605
01:09:22,491 --> 01:09:25,828
I won't kill you yet. Not 
before I make you suffer.

606
01:09:26,161 --> 01:09:28,414
I'll make you pay for 
smashing my dream.

607
01:09:28,622 --> 01:09:33,419
Your dream? That you were going to 
be the true Shogun of the Dark?

608
01:09:34,378 --> 01:09:35,838
Don't make me laugh.

609
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:41,385
If you became shogun, you'd 
make this a world of devils.

610
01:09:42,052 --> 01:09:46,807
If you enjoy their company so much... 
then go back to hell!

611
01:10:04,033 --> 01:10:05,618
I'll kill you!

612
01:10:08,954 --> 01:10:11,040
No one can kill me.

613
01:10:15,461 --> 01:10:18,339
You of all people 
should know by now...

614
01:10:21,258 --> 01:10:24,094
I am immortal.

615
01:10:27,264 --> 01:10:28,641
Is that so?

616
01:10:40,903 --> 01:10:44,406
If you keep coming 
back to life...

617
01:10:44,949 --> 01:10:48,702
...then I'll kill you as 
many times as it takes!

618
01:12:00,566 --> 01:12:02,109
You fool!

619
01:12:47,488 --> 01:12:50,574
Genma! HERE YOU DIE!

620
01:13:49,007 --> 01:13:50,384
Jubei!

621
01:13:50,384 --> 01:13:54,763
You seem to be rid of the 
poison, thanks to Kagero.

622
01:13:54,930 --> 01:13:59,351
The combination of a poison-tasting 
Kunoichi and a talented lone wolf

623
01:13:59,351 --> 01:14:01,687
worked out even better 
than I had planned.

624
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:03,272
Go away.

625
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:12,573
By the way, I'm sorry about losing Kagero. 
A real pity, that!

626
01:14:12,656 --> 01:14:15,909
But for a scant few 
moments, she was able to

627
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:19,079
be an ordinary girl and 
make love with you.

628
01:14:19,913 --> 01:14:21,915
Was that part of your plan, too?

629
01:14:21,915 --> 01:14:27,087
Exactly. To read and control peoples' 
hearts is the true secret of the ninja.

630
01:14:28,755 --> 01:14:33,385
Still, only true sincerity 
can move the human heart.

631
01:14:33,385 --> 01:14:36,263
A twisted old bastard 
like me couldn't do it.

632
01:14:36,388 --> 01:14:40,142
You're a hell of a guy. 
I really admire you.

633
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:43,145
As promised, I'll be waiting 
in Edo with your 100 ryo.

634
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:45,063
Come and get it, if 
you're still alive.

635
01:14:51,904 --> 01:14:55,407
That makes us even. Now 
never cross my path again.

636
01:14:56,408 --> 01:15:00,120
You've beaten me. I thought I'd 
shut your mouth in Edo, but...

637
01:15:00,120 --> 01:15:04,166
Still, in your condition you likely 
won't even make it to the shore.

638
01:15:04,166 --> 01:15:06,877
Everything will end 
just as I planned.
