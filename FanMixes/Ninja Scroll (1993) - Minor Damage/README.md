# Ninja Scroll: Minor Damage

A FanEdit featuring additional songs from Ninja Gaiden OST (Xbox)

## Description
Ninja Scroll is a classic with few flaws, but one of them is how women are portrayed loaded with stereotypical 
character flaws. This contrasts with how the men are established as honorable and righteous for better or worse.
This edit aims to reduce the imbalance by cutting the excessively dramatic dialog between
Jubei and Kagero, as well as Zakuro and Yurimaru. 
For the protagonists, this reduction highlights their friendship and downplays 
Kagero's need to fulfill a life debt by doing it with Jubei. 
For the antagonists, the dramatic scenes which were removed
were not essential to establishing and predicting Zakuro's betrayal of Yurimaru. 
Additionally, the rape scenes were removed, and the amount of blood shown was reduced. 

## Changes
* Drama scenes reduced
* Blood and gore reduced
* Rape scenes removed
* Added several songs from Ninja Gaiden OST (Xbox)

## Strategy
I use a minimalist approach with the following rules:
1. Cut all scenes that include excessive human behavior - yelling, screaming, being nasty to each-other, when such behavior has little or nothing to do with the plot.
2. Reduce gore scenes to around a second or less, so the audience doesn't have to 'sit there and take it'

I cut scenes on the transition frame and then mix the audio between the recombined video. Sometimes a scene is too difficult to cut on the transition frame as the audio may overlap the next shot. In this case, I decouple the audio and video and re-arrange the scene as necessary to get the result I'm looking for. With this trick, I can change who is talking to whom and reduce the tension that exists in many movie dialog scenes.
