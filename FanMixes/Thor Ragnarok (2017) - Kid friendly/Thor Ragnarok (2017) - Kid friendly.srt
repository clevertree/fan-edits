1
00:00:55,638 --> 00:00:57,348
Now, I know 
what you're thinking.

2
00:00:57,515 --> 00:01:00,894
"No! Thor's in a cage. 
How did this happen?"

3
00:01:01,060 --> 00:01:02,812
Well, sometimes 
you have to get captured

4
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:04,731
just to get a straight answer 
out of somebody.

5
00:01:06,065 --> 00:01:07,150
It's a long story,

6
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:09,194
but basically, 
I'm a bit of a hero.

7
00:01:10,653 --> 00:01:12,947
See, I spent some time 
on Earth...

8
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:14,574
fought some robots,

9
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:16,284
saved the planet 
a couple of times.

10
00:01:16,701 --> 00:01:18,328
Then I went searching 
through the cosmos

11
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:21,456
for some magic, colorful 
Infinity Stone things.

12
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,751
Didn't find any.

13
00:01:24,918 --> 00:01:26,127
That's when I came across

14
00:01:26,211 --> 00:01:28,963
a path of death 
and destruction...

15
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,841
which led me all the way here 
into this cage...

16
00:01:33,468 --> 00:01:34,803
where I met you.

17
00:01:40,725 --> 00:01:42,644
How much longer do you think 
we'll be here?

18
00:01:56,699 --> 00:02:00,286
Thor, son of Odin.

19
00:02:00,912 --> 00:02:04,207
Surtur, son of a bitch.

20
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,291
You're still alive.

21
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:09,796
I thought my father killed you 
a half a million years ago.

22
00:02:09,963 --> 00:02:11,589
I cannot die.

23
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:13,508
Not until 
I fulfill my destiny...

24
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:15,927
and lay waste to your home.

25
00:02:16,219 --> 00:02:17,595
It's funny 
you should mention that.

26
00:02:17,762 --> 00:02:20,056
Because I've been having these 
terrible dreams of late.

27
00:02:20,223 --> 00:02:22,475
Asgard up in flames, 
falling to ruins.

28
00:02:22,642 --> 00:02:23,852
And you, Surtur,

29
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,436
are at the center 
of all of them.

30
00:02:25,728 --> 00:02:29,440
Then you have seen Ragnarok, 
the fall of Asgard.

31
00:02:29,607 --> 00:02:31,442
- The great prophecy... 
- Hang on.

32
00:02:31,901 --> 00:02:34,320
Hang on.

33
00:02:34,404 --> 00:02:37,115
I'll be back around shortly.

34
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:40,243
I really feel like we were 
connecting there.

35
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:44,372
Okay, so Ragnarok.

36
00:02:44,455 --> 00:02:46,124
Tell me about that. 
Walk me through it.

37
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:48,293
My time has come.

38
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:51,588
When my crown is reunited 
with the Eternal Flame...

39
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:54,424
I shall be restored 
to my full might.

40
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,843
I will tower 
over the mountains...

41
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,596
and bury my sword 
deep in Asgard's...

42
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:02,307
Hang on. 
Give it a second.

43
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,766
I swear I'm not even moving.

44
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:05,393
It's just doing this on its own.

45
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,979
I'm really sorry.

46
00:03:08,229 --> 00:03:09,856
Okay, so let me 
get this straight.

47
00:03:10,023 --> 00:03:13,651
You're going to put your crown 
into the Eternal Flame...

48
00:03:13,818 --> 00:03:16,196
and then you'll suddenly grow 
as big as a house?

49
00:03:16,362 --> 00:03:17,530
A mountain!

50
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:20,742
The Eternal Flame that Odin 
keeps locked away on Asgard?

51
00:03:20,909 --> 00:03:23,328
Odin is not on Asgard.

52
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:27,540
And your absence has left 
the throne defenseless.

53
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,542
Okay, so where is it? 
This crown?

54
00:03:29,709 --> 00:03:32,629
This is my crown, 
the source of my power.

55
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:34,631
That's a crown.

56
00:03:34,714 --> 00:03:36,507
I thought it was a big eyebrow.

57
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:37,842
It's a crown.

58
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:41,512
Anyway, it sounds like all I 
have to do to stop Ragnarok...

59
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:43,389
is rip that thing off your head.

60
00:03:43,681 --> 00:03:47,268
But Ragnarok has already begun.

61
00:03:47,435 --> 00:03:49,228
You cannot stop it.

62
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,033
I am Asgard's doom, 
and so are you.

63
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,787
All will suffer, all will burn.

64
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:07,664
That's intense.

65
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:09,666
To be honest, 
seeing you grow really big...

66
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,335
and set fire to a planet 
would be quite the spectacle.

67
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:15,171
But it looks like I'm gonna 
have to choose option B...

68
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,090
where I bust 
out of these chains...

69
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:19,008
knock that tiara off your head,

70
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,094
and stash it away 
in Asgard's vault.

71
00:04:21,302 --> 00:04:24,263
You cannot stop Ragnarok.

72
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:25,515
Why fight it?

73
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,352
Because that's what heroes do.

74
00:04:34,315 --> 00:04:36,359
Wait, I'm sorry. 
I didn't time that right.

75
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:39,529
And, now!

76
00:04:44,158 --> 00:04:47,704
You have made 
a grave mistake, Odinson.

77
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:50,415
I make grave mistakes 
all the time.

78
00:04:52,375 --> 00:04:55,128
Everything seems to work out.

79
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:15,500
Heimdall, I know 
it's been a while,

80
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,585
but I could really use 
a fast exit.

81
00:06:19,087 --> 00:06:20,505
Heimdall?

82
00:06:21,506 --> 00:06:23,383
Heimdall was an idiot.

83
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:25,510
This job should have 
made him rich.

84
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:27,929
Now, the job ain't easy...

85
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:29,889
but it does have its benefits.

86
00:06:30,181 --> 00:06:32,433
The Bifrost gives me 
access to everything

87
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:34,435
the Nine Realms has to offer.

88
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:36,896
I mean it's all mine 
for the taking.

89
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,565
Behold...

90
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:42,902
my stuff.

91
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:46,906
I'm particularly fond of these.

92
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,618
I pulled them out of a place 
on Midgard called Texas.

93
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:53,830
I even named them. 
Des and Troy.

94
00:06:54,914 --> 00:06:57,041
You see, 
when you put them together...

95
00:06:58,042 --> 00:06:59,085
they destroy.

96
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,106
Heimdall, come on.

97
00:07:40,418 --> 00:07:41,460
Stay!

98
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:46,090
Heimdall? 
I'm running short on options.

99
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:48,843
<i>Heimdall?</i>

100
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:50,344
Skurge?

101
00:07:53,764 --> 00:07:55,099
Is that important?

102
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:03,900
You girls are in for a treat.

103
00:08:57,119 --> 00:08:58,412
Girls!

104
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:03,668
Well, well, well. 
Look who decided to pop in.

105
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,878
Thanks for scaring away 
my company

106
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,630
and drenching my workplace 
in brains.

107
00:09:07,922 --> 00:09:08,923
Who are you?

108
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:10,758
Don't you remember? 
I'm Skurge.

109
00:09:10,841 --> 00:09:12,093
We fought together on Vanaheim.

110
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:14,470
Right. Where is Heimdall?

111
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:17,640
That traitor. No one knows. 
He's a fugitive of the throne.

112
00:09:18,307 --> 00:09:19,433
Traitor?

113
00:09:19,725 --> 00:09:21,143
Yeah. Well, you see, 
Odin charged Heimdall

114
00:09:21,185 --> 00:09:22,228
with negligence of duty...

115
00:09:22,478 --> 00:09:24,272
but he disappeared 
before the trial.

116
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:25,564
Hard to catch a guy

117
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:26,691
who can see 
everything in the universe.

118
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,733
Sure.

119
00:09:27,984 --> 00:09:30,361
Hold on. I'm supposed 
to announce your arrival.

120
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,137
What the hell is that?

121
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:06,814
Brother. 
This is it.

122
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:08,357
I take my leave.

123
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:11,235
You fool, you didn't listen!

124
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,528
I'm sorry.

125
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,738
Lady Sif, get help!

126
00:10:13,821 --> 00:10:14,822
Somebody, help!

127
00:10:15,865 --> 00:10:17,158
Sorry for all I've done.

128
00:10:17,408 --> 00:10:19,076
It's all right. Hold on.

129
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:22,663
I'm sorry I tried to rule Earth.

130
00:10:22,955 --> 00:10:24,165
They'd be lucky to have you.

131
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:27,168
I'm sorry about that thing 
with the Tesseract.

132
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:29,170
- I just couldn't help myself. 
- I know.

133
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:30,504
I'm a trickster.

134
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,506
So mischievous.

135
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,384
Sorry about that time 
I turned you into a frog.

136
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:36,969
It was a wonderful joke.

137
00:10:37,345 --> 00:10:39,263
'Twas indeed hilarious.

138
00:10:39,430 --> 00:10:41,515
You are the savior of Asgard.

139
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,851
- Tell my story. 
- I will.

140
00:10:43,934 --> 00:10:45,061
Build a statue for me.

141
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:46,937
We will build 
a big statue for you.

142
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:49,982
With my helmet on, 
with the big bendy horns.

143
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:53,110
I will tell Father 
what you did here today.

144
00:10:53,652 --> 00:10:54,945
I didn't do it for him.

145
00:10:55,988 --> 00:10:58,783
I didn't do it for him.

146
00:11:07,541 --> 00:11:09,710
No!

147
00:11:13,422 --> 00:11:16,133
And so, 
Loki died of his wounds...

148
00:11:16,425 --> 00:11:18,219
giving his life for ours.

149
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:21,055
He fought back 
those disgusting elves...

150
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,015
he brought peace to the realm.

151
00:11:23,307 --> 00:11:25,476
Loki, my boy...

152
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:27,937
'twas many moons ago I found you

153
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:29,980
on that frostbitten battlefield.

154
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:33,234
On that day, 
I did not yet see in you...

155
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,694
Asgard's savior. No.

156
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:40,366
You were merely 
a little blue baby icicle...

157
00:11:41,283 --> 00:11:44,370
that melted 
this old fool's heart.

158
00:11:46,747 --> 00:11:49,333
Bravo! Bravo! 
Well done. Bravo.

159
00:11:54,088 --> 00:11:55,089
Father.

160
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:57,174
Shit.

161
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:59,802
My son, Thor, has returned!

162
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:03,180
Greetings, my boy.

163
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,057
It's an interesting play. 
What's it called?

164
00:12:05,224 --> 00:12:07,184
<i>The Tragedy of Loki of Asgard.</i>

165
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:09,186
The people wanted 
to commemorate him.

166
00:12:09,478 --> 00:12:10,688
Indeed they should.

167
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:12,148
I like the statue.

168
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:14,733
A lot better looking than he 
was when he was alive, though.

169
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:16,485
A little less weaselly, 
less greasy, maybe.

170
00:12:17,903 --> 00:12:19,613
Do you know what this is?

171
00:12:20,656 --> 00:12:23,492
The skull of Surtur. 
That's a formidable weapon!

172
00:12:23,784 --> 00:12:25,453
Do me a favor. 
Lock this away in a vault...

173
00:12:25,494 --> 00:12:27,121
so it doesn't turn 
into a giant monster

174
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,581
and destroy the whole planet.

175
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,876
Thank you, dear.

176
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,628
So it's back to Midgard 
for you, is it?

177
00:12:35,004 --> 00:12:36,005
Nope.

178
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:39,133
I've been having this 
reoccurring dream lately.

179
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,094
Every night, 
I see Asgard fall into ruins.

180
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,512
That's just a silly dream...

181
00:12:43,679 --> 00:12:45,514
signs of an overactive 
imagination.

182
00:12:45,806 --> 00:12:46,807
Possibly.

183
00:12:46,891 --> 00:12:48,851
But then I decide to go 
out there and investigate.

184
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:50,144
And what do I find,

185
00:12:50,227 --> 00:12:52,980
but the Nine Realms 
completely in chaos.

186
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:56,108
Enemies of Asgard assembling, 
plotting our demise...

187
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,818
all while you, Odin,

188
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:59,320
the protector 
of those Nine Realms...

189
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,030
are sitting here 
in your bathrobe,

190
00:13:01,113 --> 00:13:02,114
eating grapes.

191
00:13:02,198 --> 00:13:04,325
Yes, it is best to respect 
our neighbors' freedom.

192
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,578
Yes, of course, 
the freedom to be massacred.

193
00:13:09,497 --> 00:13:11,540
Yes, besides I've been 
rather busy myself.

194
00:13:11,832 --> 00:13:12,833
Watching theater.

195
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,794
Board meetings, and security 
council meetings...

196
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,253
You're really gonna 
make me do it?

197
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,463
Do what?

198
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,177
You know that 
nothing will stop Mjolnir

199
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,762
as it returns to my hand.

200
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:26,388
Not even your face.

201
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:28,766
You've gone quite mad. 
You'll be executed for this.

202
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,477
Then I'll see you 
on the other side, brother.

203
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:34,271
All right, I yield.

204
00:13:44,573 --> 00:13:45,574
Behold!

205
00:13:46,534 --> 00:13:47,618
Thor...

206
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:49,745
- Odinson. 
- No.

207
00:13:51,956 --> 00:13:53,791
You had one job. Just the one.

208
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,961
Where's Odin?

209
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:58,879
You just couldn't stay away, 
could you?

210
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:00,923
Everything was fine without you.

211
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,759
Asgard was prospering. 
You've ruined everything.

212
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:05,261
- Ask them. 
- Where's Father?

213
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:07,012
- Did you kill him? 
- You had what you wanted.

214
00:14:07,054 --> 00:14:08,556
You had the independence 
you asked for.

215
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,433
Okay. I know exactly 
where he is.

216
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,698
I swear I left him right here.

217
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,450
Right here on the sidewalk,

218
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,119
or right there where the 
building is being demolished?

219
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,161
Great planning.

220
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,621
How was I supposed to know?

221
00:14:32,705 --> 00:14:34,373
Can't see into the future. 
I'm not a witch.

222
00:14:34,498 --> 00:14:36,292
No? Then why do you dress 
like one?

223
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,669
- Hey. 
- I can't believe you're alive.

224
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,296
I saw you die.

225
00:14:40,379 --> 00:14:42,089
I mourned you, I cried for you.

226
00:14:42,298 --> 00:14:43,465
I'm honored.

227
00:14:43,841 --> 00:14:44,842
Ask him.

228
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,719
Hi. Would you mind taking 
a picture with us?

229
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:48,887
Sure.

230
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,514
Start figuring out where he is.

231
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:52,516
My God.

232
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,976
Sorry to hear 
that Jane dumped you.

233
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:56,437
She didn't dump me, you know.

234
00:14:56,979 --> 00:14:58,772
I dumped her. 
It was a mutual dumping.

235
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,735
What's this? 
What are you doing?

236
00:15:02,943 --> 00:15:03,944
This isn't me.

237
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,658
Loki.

238
00:15:34,683 --> 00:15:36,602
Thor Odinson.

239
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,697
God of Thunder.

240
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:51,283
You can put down the umbrella.

241
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:11,095
So, Earth has, wizards now?

242
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,394
The preferred term is

243
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,521
"Master of the Mystic Arts." 
You can leave that now.

244
00:16:21,522 --> 00:16:22,856
All right, wizard.

245
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:24,233
Who are you? 
Why should I care?

246
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:26,568
My name 
is Doctor Stephen Strange,

247
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:28,612
and I have some questions 
for you.

248
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:29,697
Take a seat.

249
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:35,828
Tea?

250
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:39,623
I don't drink tea.

251
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:41,041
What do you drink?

252
00:16:41,417 --> 00:16:42,501
Not tea.

253
00:16:45,838 --> 00:16:47,589
So, I keep a watch list

254
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:49,508
of individuals and beings 
from other realms...

255
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:51,343
that may be a threat 
to this world.

256
00:16:51,427 --> 00:16:55,013
Your adopted brother, Loki, 
is one of those beings.

257
00:16:55,431 --> 00:16:57,683
He's a worthy inclusion.

258
00:16:59,685 --> 00:17:01,103
Then why bring him here?

259
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:02,938
We're looking for my father.

260
00:17:03,355 --> 00:17:06,442
So, if I were to tell you 
where Odin was...

261
00:17:06,942 --> 00:17:09,111
all parties concerned would 
promptly return to Asgard?

262
00:17:09,486 --> 00:17:10,487
Promptly.

263
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,864
Great! Then I'll help you.

264
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,283
If you knew where he was, 
why didn't you call me?

265
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,201
I have to tell you, 
he was adamant

266
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:17,244
that he not be disturbed.

267
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,496
Your father said he had chosen 
to remain in exile.

268
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:23,709
And you don't have a phone.

269
00:17:24,293 --> 00:17:25,794
No, I don't have a phone...

270
00:17:26,086 --> 00:17:27,755
but you could have sent 
an electronic letter.

271
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:28,881
It's called an email.

272
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:30,841
- Yeah, do you have a computer? 
- No. What for?

273
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:32,885
Anyway,

274
00:17:32,968 --> 00:17:34,553
my father is no longer in exile.

275
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:36,388
So if you could 
tell me where he is,

276
00:17:36,472 --> 00:17:37,473
I can take him home.

277
00:17:37,765 --> 00:17:39,516
Gladly. He's in Norway.

278
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,686
I'm just seeing 
whether this incantation

279
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:45,773
requires any Asgardian 
modifications.

280
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:47,483
Nope.

281
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,526
We don't need that.

282
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,659
Will you stop doing that?

283
00:17:59,119 --> 00:18:01,872
I need just one strand 
of your hair.

284
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,123
Let me explain something.

285
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:05,709
My hair is not to be 
meddled with.

286
00:18:13,550 --> 00:18:14,718
We could have just walked.

287
00:18:17,721 --> 00:18:19,306
He's waiting for you.

288
00:18:19,598 --> 00:18:20,682
All right.

289
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:22,226
Don't forget your umbrella.

290
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:23,644
Yes.

291
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,444
Sorry.

292
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:36,698
There we go.

293
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,701
I suppose I'll need 
my brother back.

294
00:18:40,327 --> 00:18:41,537
Yeah. Right.

295
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,087
I have been falling 
for 30 minutes!

296
00:18:51,088 --> 00:18:52,256
You can handle him from here.

297
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,007
Yes. Of course.

298
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,467
Thank you very much 
for your help.

299
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:56,677
Good luck.

300
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,720
Handle me? Who are you?

301
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:00,472
Loki.

302
00:19:00,722 --> 00:19:02,099
You think you're 
some kind of sorcerer?

303
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:03,934
Don't think for one minute, 
you second-rate...

304
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:04,977
Bye-bye.

305
00:19:30,377 --> 00:19:31,378
Father?

306
00:19:33,213 --> 00:19:35,674
Look at this place. 
It's beautiful.

307
00:19:41,096 --> 00:19:42,514
Father, it's us.

308
00:19:45,934 --> 00:19:47,436
My sons.

309
00:19:48,604 --> 00:19:49,730
I've been waiting for you.

310
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,648
I know. We've come 
to take you home.

311
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:53,483
Home, yes.

312
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,446
Your mother, she calls me.

313
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:00,991
Do you hear it?

314
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,661
Loki, lift your magic.

315
00:20:07,331 --> 00:20:09,833
Took me quite a while 
to break free from your spell.

316
00:20:10,125 --> 00:20:11,501
Frigga would have been proud.

317
00:20:11,793 --> 00:20:14,296
Come and sit with me. 
I don't have much time.

318
00:20:21,178 --> 00:20:22,679
I know that we failed you.

319
00:20:23,013 --> 00:20:24,139
But we can make this right.

320
00:20:24,890 --> 00:20:26,099
I failed you.

321
00:20:27,142 --> 00:20:29,728
It is upon us. Ragnarok.

322
00:20:30,145 --> 00:20:32,689
No, I've stopped Ragnarok. 
I put an end to Surtur.

323
00:20:33,482 --> 00:20:34,483
No.

324
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:37,027
It has already begun. 
She's coming.

325
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:40,405
My life was all that 
held her back.

326
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:41,490
But my time has come.

327
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,161
I cannot keep her away 
any longer.

328
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,121
Father, who are you 
talking about?

329
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,792
Goddess of Death. Hela.

330
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:54,378
My firstborn.

331
00:20:55,587 --> 00:20:56,588
Your sister.

332
00:20:59,716 --> 00:21:01,343
Your what?

333
00:21:03,929 --> 00:21:06,640
Her violent appetites 
grew beyond my control.

334
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:10,978
I couldn't stop her, 
so I imprisoned her.

335
00:21:11,061 --> 00:21:12,145
Locked her away.

336
00:21:13,397 --> 00:21:16,400
She draws her strength 
from Asgard...

337
00:21:17,734 --> 00:21:21,238
and once she gets there, 
her powers will be limitless.

338
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,031
Whatever she is, 
we can stop her together.

339
00:21:23,073 --> 00:21:24,074
We can face her together.

340
00:21:24,324 --> 00:21:25,325
No, we won't.

341
00:21:26,618 --> 00:21:28,453
I'm on a different path now.

342
00:21:28,787 --> 00:21:30,080
This you must face alone.

343
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,209
I love you, my sons.

344
00:21:37,045 --> 00:21:38,422
Look at that.

345
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:44,177
Remember this place.

346
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,055
Home.

347
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,055
Brother.

348
00:22:35,896 --> 00:22:38,482
This was your doing.

349
00:23:21,066 --> 00:23:22,275
So he's gone.

350
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,490
That's a shame. I would've 
liked to have seen that.

351
00:23:28,990 --> 00:23:30,408
You must be Hela.

352
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:33,328
I'm Thor, son of Odin.

353
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:36,081
Really? 
You don't look like him.

354
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:39,167
Perhaps we can come 
to an arrangement.

355
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:41,211
You sound like him.

356
00:23:43,296 --> 00:23:44,297
Kneel.

357
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:45,799
Beg your pardon?

358
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:51,638
Kneel.

359
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:56,726
Before your queen.

360
00:23:58,145 --> 00:23:59,396
I don't think so.

361
00:24:10,115 --> 00:24:12,117
It's not possible.

362
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:16,830
Darling, you have no idea 
what's possible.

363
00:24:37,142 --> 00:24:38,143
Bring us back!

364
00:24:38,226 --> 00:24:39,227
No!

365
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:49,404
Loki!

366
00:25:36,576 --> 00:25:38,203
Who are you? 
What have you done with Thor?

367
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:44,417
I'm Hela.

368
00:25:46,753 --> 00:25:48,296
I'm just a janitor.

369
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:52,884
You look like a smart boy 
with good survival instincts.

370
00:25:55,971 --> 00:25:57,639
How would you like a job?

371
00:28:09,145 --> 00:28:10,605
Are you a fighter?

372
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:12,774
Or are you food?

373
00:28:13,566 --> 00:28:14,943
I'm just passing through.

374
00:28:15,652 --> 00:28:16,945
It is food.

375
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,321
On your knees.

376
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:02,407
He's mine.

377
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:12,792
Wait!

378
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:22,844
Wait!

379
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:26,181
He's mine.

380
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,517
So if you want him, 
you go through me.

381
00:29:29,893 --> 00:29:31,144
But we've already got him.

382
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:35,732
All right, then. 
I guess I go through you.

383
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:37,734
More food.

384
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:14,437
Thank you.

385
00:30:49,806 --> 00:30:53,268
Scrapper 142. I need clearance 
and an audience with the boss.

386
00:30:53,851 --> 00:30:55,520
I've got something special.

387
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:58,022
Hey! Where are you taking me?

388
00:30:59,566 --> 00:31:00,692
Answer me!

389
00:31:01,067 --> 00:31:02,151
Hey!

390
00:31:02,610 --> 00:31:04,988
I am Thor, son of Odin. 
I need to get back to Asgard.

391
00:31:06,155 --> 00:31:08,241
Many apologies, your majesty.

392
00:31:36,978 --> 00:31:40,523
It's come to my attention 
that you don't know who I am.

393
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:51,200
I am Hela, Odin's firstborn...

394
00:31:51,326 --> 00:31:53,578
the commander 
of the Legions of Asgard...

395
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,496
the rightful heir to the throne,

396
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:57,123
and the Goddess of Death.

397
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:04,297
My father is dead.

398
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,341
As are the princes. 
You're welcome.

399
00:32:07,091 --> 00:32:08,426
We were once the seat

400
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:10,386
of absolute power in the cosmos.

401
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,764
Our supremacy was unchallenged.

402
00:32:13,056 --> 00:32:16,017
Yet Odin stopped at Nine Realms.

403
00:32:16,309 --> 00:32:19,604
Our destiny is to rule over 
all others.

404
00:32:20,521 --> 00:32:23,566
And I am here 
to restore that power.

405
00:32:25,234 --> 00:32:26,736
Kneel before me...

406
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:30,782
and rise into the ranks 
of my great conquest.

407
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,118
Whoever you are...

408
00:32:34,327 --> 00:32:37,246
whatever you've done, 
surrender now!

409
00:32:37,538 --> 00:32:39,624
Or we will show you no mercy.

410
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,334
Whoever I am?

411
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,003
Did you listen to a word I said?

412
00:32:44,295 --> 00:32:46,172
This is your last warning!

413
00:32:48,424 --> 00:32:50,510
I thought you'd be happy 
to see me.

414
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:57,558
Fine.

415
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:12,156
Charge!

416
00:34:06,335 --> 00:34:08,463
I've missed this.

417
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:10,298
Still, it's a shame.

418
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:13,259
Good soldiers dying 
for nothing...

419
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:15,511
all because 
they couldn't see the future.

420
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,221
Sad.

421
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:20,433
Look, still alive.

422
00:34:28,107 --> 00:34:29,692
Change of heart?

423
00:34:30,109 --> 00:34:32,361
Go back to whatever cave 
you crept out of.

424
00:34:33,905 --> 00:34:35,114
You evil demoness!

425
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:41,078
Let's go see my palace.

426
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,278
<i>Fear not, for you are found.</i>

427
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,324
<i>You are home, 
and there is no going back.</i>

428
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:23,746
<i>No one leaves this place.</i>

429
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:25,623
<i>But what is this place?</i>

430
00:35:25,832 --> 00:35:28,918
<i>The answer is Sakaar.</i>

431
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:33,047
<i>Surrounded by cosmic gateways...</i>

432
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:35,967
<i>Sakaar lives on the edge 
of the known and unknown.</i>

433
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:37,927
<i>It is the collection point</i>

434
00:35:38,010 --> 00:35:39,679
<i>for all lost 
and unloved things...</i>

435
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,639
<i>like you.</i>

436
00:35:41,848 --> 00:35:44,475
<i>But here on Sakaar, 
you are significant.</i>

437
00:35:44,809 --> 00:35:46,185
<i>You are valuable.</i>

438
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,895
<i>Here you are loved.</i>

439
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:48,980
What the hell?

440
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:52,149
<i>And no one loves you more 
than the Grandmaster.</i>

441
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:54,402
<i>He is the original,</i>

442
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,529
<i>the first lost 
and the first found...</i>

443
00:35:56,737 --> 00:35:57,822
<i>the creator of Sakaar...</i>

444
00:35:58,156 --> 00:36:01,200
<i>and father 
of the Contest of Champions.</i>

445
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:05,663
<i>Where once you were nothing, 
now you are something.</i>

446
00:36:05,079 --> 00:36:09,041
<i>You are the property 
of the Grandmaster.</i>

447
00:36:09,417 --> 00:36:10,751
<i>Congratulations!</i>

448
00:36:11,002 --> 00:36:14,338
<i>You will meet the Grandmaster 
in 5 seconds.</i>

449
00:36:14,797 --> 00:36:16,048
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

450
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:19,093
<i>Prepare yourself.</i>

451
00:36:20,803 --> 00:36:24,015
<i>You are now meeting 
the Grandmaster.</i>

452
00:36:37,069 --> 00:36:39,196
He's wonderful. 
It is a he?

453
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:40,698
It is a he.

454
00:36:40,781 --> 00:36:41,782
Yeah.

455
00:36:41,991 --> 00:36:43,951
I love when you come 
to visit, 142.

456
00:36:44,118 --> 00:36:45,620
You bring me the best stuff.

457
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:47,705
Whenever we get 
to talking, Topaz,

458
00:36:47,788 --> 00:36:49,498
about Scrapper 142...

459
00:36:49,707 --> 00:36:51,083
what do I always say?

460
00:36:51,167 --> 00:36:53,127
"She is the..." 
And it starts with a "B."

461
00:36:53,336 --> 00:36:54,337
Trash.

462
00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:57,089
No, not trash.

463
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,550
Were you waiting 
just to call her that?

464
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:00,968
It doesn't start with a "B."

465
00:37:01,260 --> 00:37:02,261
Booze hag.

466
00:37:05,056 --> 00:37:07,266
I'm so sorry. No, "best." 
I was thinking about "best."

467
00:37:07,516 --> 00:37:08,935
'Cause I always say 
you're the best.

468
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,811
She brought me my beloved 
champion, you know.

469
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,813
You say that every time 
she's here.

470
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,482
What have you brought today? 
Tell me.

471
00:37:14,565 --> 00:37:15,566
A contender.

472
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:16,776
A what?

473
00:37:17,109 --> 00:37:19,070
I need to go closer. 
I want a closer look at this.

474
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,113
Can you take us closer? 
Thank you.

475
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:34,710
Pay this lady.

476
00:37:34,877 --> 00:37:36,504
Just wait a damn minute.

477
00:37:36,796 --> 00:37:39,048
I'm not for sale.

478
00:37:45,513 --> 00:37:47,014
Man, he's a fighter.

479
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:48,474
I take 10 million.

480
00:37:48,766 --> 00:37:49,767
Tell her she's dreaming.

481
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,811
For heaven's sakes, 
transfer the units.

482
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:00,403
You'll pay for this.

483
00:38:00,778 --> 00:38:01,988
No, I got paid for this.

484
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:05,366
Here's what I wanna know.

485
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:08,160
Who are you?

486
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:12,206
I am the God of Thunder.

487
00:38:15,584 --> 00:38:16,794
I didn't hear any thunder,

488
00:38:16,877 --> 00:38:18,921
but out of your fingers, 
was that sparkles?

489
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,257
What happened to my manners?

490
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:23,092
I haven't 
properly introduced myself.

491
00:38:23,342 --> 00:38:25,136
Come on. Follow me.

492
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,555
My name is Grandmaster.

493
00:38:27,763 --> 00:38:29,557
I preside over 
a little harlequinade

494
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,058
called the Contest of Champions.

495
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,727
People come from far and wide

496
00:38:32,810 --> 00:38:34,103
to unwillingly 
participate in it.

497
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:35,396
And you, my friend,

498
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:36,981
might just be part 
of the new cast.

499
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,190
What do you say to that?

500
00:38:38,274 --> 00:38:40,443
We're not friends and I don't 
give a shit about your games.

501
00:38:40,484 --> 00:38:41,736
I'm going back to Asgard.

502
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,196
Ass-gard.

503
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,991
One, two, three, four.

504
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,745
There was a wormhole 
in space and time beneath me.

505
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:54,081
At that moment, I let go.

506
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,332
Loki?

507
00:38:56,792 --> 00:38:58,377
Loki! Loki!

508
00:38:58,627 --> 00:39:01,881
Over here. Over here.

509
00:39:02,131 --> 00:39:03,341
- Excuse me one second. 
- Loki!

510
00:39:05,343 --> 00:39:06,510
- What? 
- You're alive?

511
00:39:06,594 --> 00:39:08,512
- Yes, of course I'm alive. 
- What are you doing here?

512
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:09,597
What do you mean, 
what am I doing?

513
00:39:09,638 --> 00:39:10,681
I'm stuck in this stupid chair.

514
00:39:10,723 --> 00:39:12,350
- Where's your chair? 
- I didn't get a chair.

515
00:39:12,391 --> 00:39:13,726
- Get me out of this one. 
- I can't.

516
00:39:13,768 --> 00:39:15,102
- Get me out. What? 
- I can't.

517
00:39:15,186 --> 00:39:16,228
I've made friends with this man.

518
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:17,313
He's called the Grandmaster.

519
00:39:17,355 --> 00:39:18,731
- He's crazy! 
- I've gained his favor.

520
00:39:18,773 --> 00:39:20,399
The Bifrost brought me 
out here weeks ago.

521
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,525
- Weeks ago? 
- Yes.

522
00:39:21,734 --> 00:39:22,735
I just got here.

523
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:24,195
What are you whispering about?

524
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,031
Time works real different 
around these parts.

525
00:39:27,198 --> 00:39:30,117
On any other world, I'd be, 
like, millions of years old.

526
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:31,911
But here on Sakaar...

527
00:39:37,458 --> 00:39:40,002
In any case, you know this...

528
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,420
You call yourself 
Lord of Thunder?

529
00:39:41,504 --> 00:39:43,881
God of Thunder. 
Tell him.

530
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:45,758
I've never met this man 
in my life.

531
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:47,551
- He's my brother. 
- Adopted.

532
00:39:47,635 --> 00:39:48,761
Is he any kind of a fighter?

533
00:39:49,095 --> 00:39:50,137
You take this thing

534
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,430
out of my neck 
and I'll show you.

535
00:39:51,472 --> 00:39:53,057
Now, listen to that. 
He's threatening me.

536
00:39:53,307 --> 00:39:55,184
Hey, Sparkles, here's the deal.

537
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,561
If you wanna get back 
to Ass-place, Assberg...

538
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:58,896
Asgard.

539
00:39:58,979 --> 00:40:01,816
Any contender who defeats 
my champion...

540
00:40:02,024 --> 00:40:03,734
their freedom they shall win.

541
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,569
Fine. Then point me 
in the direction

542
00:40:05,653 --> 00:40:07,113
of whoever's ass I have to kick!

543
00:40:07,446 --> 00:40:09,865
That's what I call, contender.

544
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:12,410
Direction would be 
this way, Lord.

545
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:14,078
Loki!

546
00:40:19,834 --> 00:40:21,961
Hey, hey, hey. 
Take it easy, man.

547
00:40:23,045 --> 00:40:24,755
Over here.

548
00:40:24,922 --> 00:40:26,424
The pile of rocks 
waving at you. Here.

549
00:40:26,674 --> 00:40:29,135
Yeah, I'm actually a thing. 
I'm a being.

550
00:40:29,385 --> 00:40:31,011
Allow me to introduce myself. 
My name is Korg.

551
00:40:31,053 --> 00:40:32,471
I'm kind of like 
the leader in here.

552
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,390
I'm made of rocks, 
as you can see.

553
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:35,933
But don't let that 
intimidate you.

554
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,393
You don't need to be afraid

555
00:40:37,476 --> 00:40:39,019
unless you're made of scissors.

556
00:40:39,228 --> 00:40:40,437
Just a little rock-paper-scissor

557
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:41,480
joke for you.

558
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:44,400
This is my very good friend 
over here, Miek.

559
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,319
He's an insect 
and has knives for hands.

560
00:40:48,070 --> 00:40:49,363
You're a Kronan, aren't you?

561
00:40:49,738 --> 00:40:52,199
- That I am. 
- How'd you end up in here?

562
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,160
Well, I tried to start 
a revolution,

563
00:40:54,243 --> 00:40:55,536
but didn't print 
enough pamphlets.

564
00:40:55,578 --> 00:40:56,954
So hardly anyone turned up,

565
00:40:57,037 --> 00:40:59,623
except for my mum 
and her boyfriend, who I hate.

566
00:40:59,957 --> 00:41:01,250
As punishment, I was forced

567
00:41:01,333 --> 00:41:03,711
to be in here 
and become a gladiator.

568
00:41:03,919 --> 00:41:05,462
Bit of a promotional disaster, 
that one.

569
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,132
But I'm actually organizing 
another revolution.

570
00:41:08,424 --> 00:41:09,466
I don't know 
if you'd be interested

571
00:41:09,508 --> 00:41:10,551
in something like that.

572
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:12,303
Do you reckon 
you'd be interested?

573
00:41:14,597 --> 00:41:15,598
How did you...

574
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:18,434
Yeah, no. 
This whole thing is a circle.

575
00:41:18,726 --> 00:41:21,770
But not a real circle, 
more like a freaky circle.

576
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,272
This doesn't make any sense.

577
00:41:23,355 --> 00:41:24,690
No, nothing makes sense 
here, man.

578
00:41:24,899 --> 00:41:26,275
The only thing 
that does make sense

579
00:41:26,358 --> 00:41:27,735
is that nothing makes sense.

580
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:30,279
Has anyone here fought 
the Grandmaster's champion?

581
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,572
Doug has.

582
00:41:31,739 --> 00:41:32,740
Doug!

583
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:33,991
Our luck, Doug's dead.

584
00:41:34,074 --> 00:41:35,075
That's right.

585
00:41:35,242 --> 00:41:36,327
Everyone who fights

586
00:41:36,410 --> 00:41:37,828
the Grandmaster's champion 
perishes.

587
00:41:37,953 --> 00:41:39,497
What about you? 
You're made of rocks.

588
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:42,291
Perishable rock. There you go. 
Another one gone.

589
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:44,376
Yeah, no, I just do 
the smaller fights,

590
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:46,295
warm up the crowd and whatnot.

591
00:41:46,587 --> 00:41:48,214
Wait. You're not gonna 
face him, are you?

592
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:49,798
Yes, I am.

593
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,884
Gonna fight him, win,

594
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,344
and get the hell out 
of this place.

595
00:41:54,011 --> 00:41:55,763
That's exactly 
what Doug used to say.

596
00:41:56,096 --> 00:41:57,806
See you later, new Doug.

597
00:42:07,733 --> 00:42:09,360
Does no one remember me?

598
00:42:10,152 --> 00:42:12,404
Has no one been taught 
our history?

599
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:19,537
Look at these lies.

600
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:21,705
Goblets and garden parties?

601
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,626
Peace treaties?

602
00:42:26,544 --> 00:42:27,670
Odin...

603
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,421
proud to have it...

604
00:42:29,713 --> 00:42:30,965
ashamed of how he got it.

605
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,528
We were unstoppable.

606
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:54,530
I was his weapon in the conquest

607
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:57,074
that built Asgard's empire.

608
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:03,247
One by one, 
the realms became ours.

609
00:43:03,497 --> 00:43:07,585
But then, simply because 
my ambition outgrew his...

610
00:43:07,876 --> 00:43:12,423
he banished me, caged me, 
locked me away like an animal.

611
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,467
Before that, Asgard's warriors 
were honored...

612
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:19,263
their bodies buried as heroes 
beneath this very palace.

613
00:43:30,524 --> 00:43:32,192
- Odin's treasures. 
- Fake.

614
00:43:34,486 --> 00:43:36,905
Most of the stuff in here 
is fake.

615
00:43:37,615 --> 00:43:38,699
Or weak.

616
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,786
Smaller than I thought 
it would be.

617
00:43:43,954 --> 00:43:45,456
That's not bad.

618
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:47,207
But this...

619
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:49,918
The Eternal Flame.

620
00:44:18,364 --> 00:44:20,532
Want to see what true power 
really looks like?

621
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:51,980
Fenris, my darling, 
what have they done to you?

622
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:58,529
With the Eternal Flame, 
you are reborn.

623
00:45:14,211 --> 00:45:16,004
I've missed you.

624
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:18,757
I've missed you all.

625
00:45:21,593 --> 00:45:22,594
Odin...

626
00:45:22,886 --> 00:45:26,056
I bid you take your place 
in the halls of Valhalla...

627
00:45:26,348 --> 00:45:28,600
where the brave 
shall live forever.

628
00:45:30,144 --> 00:45:32,396
Nor shall we mourn 
but rejoice...

629
00:45:32,771 --> 00:45:34,022
for those that have died...

630
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,399
the glorious death.

631
00:45:43,490 --> 00:45:44,783
Hurts, doesn't it?

632
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:46,076
Being lied to.

633
00:45:47,119 --> 00:45:48,454
Being told you're one thing

634
00:45:48,537 --> 00:45:50,414
and then learning 
it's all a fiction.

635
00:45:55,377 --> 00:45:57,504
You didn't think I'd really 
come and see you, did you?

636
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,173
This place is disgusting.

637
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:03,886
Does this mean 
you don't want my help?

638
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:06,221
Look, I couldn't jeopardize my 
position with the Grandmaster.

639
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,639
It took me time 
to win his trust.

640
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:09,224
He's a lunatic, 
but he can be amenable.

641
00:46:09,516 --> 00:46:10,726
What I'm telling you is,

642
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:12,603
you could join me 
at the Grandmaster's side.

643
00:46:12,853 --> 00:46:13,854
Perhaps, in time,

644
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,399
an accident befalls 
the Grandmaster, and then...

645
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,824
You're not seriously thinking 
of going back, are you?

646
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:30,120
Our sister destroyed your hammer

647
00:46:31,079 --> 00:46:32,456
like a piece of glass.

648
00:46:33,540 --> 00:46:35,375
She's stronger than both of 
us. She's stronger than you.

649
00:46:35,417 --> 00:46:36,710
You don't stand a chance.

650
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:39,046
Do you understand 
what I'm saying to you?

651
00:46:43,592 --> 00:46:44,593
Fine.

652
00:46:47,304 --> 00:46:49,765
I guess 
I'll just have to go it alone.

653
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,683
Like I've always done.

654
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,979
Would you say something?

655
00:46:58,774 --> 00:47:00,192
Say something!

656
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:03,529
What would you like me to say?

657
00:47:04,029 --> 00:47:06,114
You faked your own death...

658
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:08,909
you stole the throne, 
stripped Odin of his power...

659
00:47:09,159 --> 00:47:10,619
stranded him on Earth to die,

660
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,329
releasing the Goddess of Death.

661
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,164
Have I said enough or would 
you like me to go back

662
00:47:14,206 --> 00:47:16,124
further than the past two days?

663
00:47:17,834 --> 00:47:19,211
You know, I haven't seen this

664
00:47:19,294 --> 00:47:21,338
beloved champion he talks of...

665
00:47:21,630 --> 00:47:23,507
but I've heard 
he is astonishingly savage.

666
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,885
I've placed a large wager 
against you tomorrow.

667
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:29,263
Don't let me down.

668
00:47:33,308 --> 00:47:34,726
Piss off, ghost!

669
00:47:37,312 --> 00:47:38,772
He's freaking gone.

670
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:48,198
Yuck!

671
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:50,409
There's still someone's hair 
and blood all over this.

672
00:47:50,701 --> 00:47:52,035
Guys, can you clean up 
the weapons

673
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,287
once you finish your fight?

674
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:54,454
Disgusting slobs.

675
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:57,124
Thor...

676
00:47:57,624 --> 00:47:59,418
wanna use a big wooden fork?

677
00:47:59,793 --> 00:48:00,794
No.

678
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:02,087
Yeah, not really useful.

679
00:48:02,296 --> 00:48:04,006
Unless you're fighting off 
three vampires

680
00:48:04,089 --> 00:48:05,674
that were huddled together.

681
00:48:06,675 --> 00:48:08,135
I really wish I had my hammer.

682
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,553
Hammer?

683
00:48:09,761 --> 00:48:11,263
Quite unique. 
It was made from this

684
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,307
special metal from the heart 
of a dying star.

685
00:48:13,890 --> 00:48:15,392
And when I spun it really, 
really fast,

686
00:48:15,434 --> 00:48:16,935
it gave me the ability to fly.

687
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:18,061
You rode a hammer?

688
00:48:18,312 --> 00:48:19,730
No, I didn't ride the hammer.

689
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:21,440
The hammer rode you 
on your back?

690
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,150
No. I used to spin it 
really fast,

691
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,818
and it would pull me off the...

692
00:48:24,901 --> 00:48:26,987
My God. 
A hammer pulled you off?

693
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:28,822
The ground. It would pull me 
off the ground,

694
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,699
up into the air, 
and I would fly.

695
00:48:30,991 --> 00:48:31,992
Every time I threw it,

696
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:33,869
it would always come back to me.

697
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,412
Sounds like you had 
a pretty special

698
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,872
and intimate relationship 
with this hammer...

699
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,040
and that losing it

700
00:48:38,123 --> 00:48:39,917
was almost comparable 
to losing a loved one.

701
00:48:41,043 --> 00:48:43,128
That's a nice way of putting it.

702
00:48:44,796 --> 00:48:46,048
I said they're mine.

703
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:49,468
See her, that's the one 
that put me in here.

704
00:48:49,801 --> 00:48:52,012
Yeah. Scrapper 142.

705
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,222
Gotta watch out 
for those Asgardians, man.

706
00:48:54,306 --> 00:48:55,891
They are hard to perish.

707
00:48:56,099 --> 00:48:57,476
Asgardian?

708
00:48:59,311 --> 00:49:01,188
Hey. Hey.

709
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:02,939
Hey.

710
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:05,942
Do not zap me with that thing. 
I just wanna talk.

711
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:09,029
Asgard is in danger.

712
00:49:13,533 --> 00:49:14,993
My God, you're a Valkyrie.

713
00:49:16,078 --> 00:49:18,288
I used to wanna be a Valkyrie 
when I was younger...

714
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,916
until I found out that 
you were all women.

715
00:49:21,083 --> 00:49:22,125
There's nothing wrong 
with women, of course.

716
00:49:22,167 --> 00:49:23,168
I love women.

717
00:49:23,377 --> 00:49:24,795
Sometimes a little too much.

718
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:26,046
Not in a creepy way,

719
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:27,839
just more 
of a respectful appreciation.

720
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,424
I think it's great that there is

721
00:49:29,466 --> 00:49:32,511
an elite force 
of women warriors.

722
00:49:32,761 --> 00:49:34,179
It's about time.

723
00:49:35,681 --> 00:49:36,807
Are you done?

724
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:37,933
Lord of Thunder, you're up.

725
00:49:37,975 --> 00:49:39,101
Please, help me. 
I need your help.

726
00:49:39,142 --> 00:49:40,143
Bye.

727
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:42,396
Fine, then you must be 
a traitor or a coward.

728
00:49:42,688 --> 00:49:44,940
Because the Valkyrie is sworn 
to protect the throne.

729
00:49:45,565 --> 00:49:48,735
Listen closely, your majesty. 
This is Sakaar, not Asgard.

730
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:50,946
And I'm a Scrapper, 
not a Valkyrie.

731
00:49:54,282 --> 00:49:56,159
Bring him in for processing.

732
00:49:56,535 --> 00:50:00,247
And no one escapes this place. 
So you're gonna die anyway.

733
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:13,635
Now, don't you move.

734
00:50:14,011 --> 00:50:16,513
My hands ain't as steady 
as they used to be.

735
00:50:16,763 --> 00:50:19,558
By Odin's beard, 
you shall not cut my hair...

736
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,352
lest you feel the wrath 
of the mighty Thor.

737
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:29,109
Please. Please, kind sir, 
do not cut my hair.

738
00:50:30,444 --> 00:50:31,778
Please! No!

739
00:50:31,987 --> 00:50:33,029
No!

740
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:48,086
<i>Look at all of you.</i>

741
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,838
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

742
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:51,089
<i>Who's having fun?</i>

743
00:50:52,007 --> 00:50:53,884
<i>Please, I'm your host.</i>

744
00:50:54,134 --> 00:50:55,302
<i>Big round of applause</i>

745
00:50:55,385 --> 00:50:57,262
<i>for all of our 
undercard competitors...</i>

746
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,223
<i>who today died so gruesomely.</i>

747
00:51:00,474 --> 00:51:01,600
<i>Good sports.</i>

748
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:03,435
<i>What a show! What a night!</i>

749
00:51:04,144 --> 00:51:07,773
<i>This is what you've come for, 
and so have I.</i>

750
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:16,656
<i>And now, without further ado...</i>

751
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:19,242
<i>it's main event time.</i>

752
00:51:21,161 --> 00:51:22,621
<i>Making his first appearance,</i>

753
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,247
<i>though he looks 
quite promising...</i>

754
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,374
<i>got a couple of tricks 
up his sleeve.</i>

755
00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,419
<i>I'll say no more, 
see what you think.</i>

756
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,296
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, 
I give you...</i>

757
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:34,382
<i>Lord of Thunder.</i>

758
00:51:57,697 --> 00:51:59,866
<i>Watch out for his fingers. 
They make sparks.</i>

759
00:51:59,950 --> 00:52:01,284
<i>Okay, this is it.</i>

760
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:04,704
<i>Let's get ready to welcome 
this guy. Here he comes.</i>

761
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:15,131
<i>He is a creature.</i>

762
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:16,633
<i>What can we say about him?</i>

763
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:19,177
<i>Well, he's unique. 
There's none like him.</i>

764
00:52:19,427 --> 00:52:21,847
<i>I feel a special connection 
with him.</i>

765
00:52:23,682 --> 00:52:24,850
<i>He's undefeated.</i>

766
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:27,727
<i>He's the reigning.</i>

767
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:32,190
<i>He's the defending.</i>

768
00:52:32,691 --> 00:52:33,692
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

769
00:52:34,109 --> 00:52:35,110
<i>I give you...</i>

770
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,660
<i>your Incredible...</i>

771
00:52:47,497 --> 00:52:49,332
Hulk!

772
00:52:49,958 --> 00:52:51,293
Yes!

773
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:57,090
I have to get off this planet.

774
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:59,593
Hey, hey, hey. 
Where you going?

775
00:53:07,976 --> 00:53:09,102
Hey!

776
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,021
We know each other.

777
00:53:11,479 --> 00:53:13,356
He's a friend from work.

778
00:53:22,741 --> 00:53:24,284
Where have you been?

779
00:53:24,492 --> 00:53:26,494
Everybody thought you were dead.

780
00:53:26,786 --> 00:53:28,580
But so much has happened 
since I last saw you.

781
00:53:29,205 --> 00:53:30,749
I lost my hammer.

782
00:53:30,916 --> 00:53:33,877
Like, yesterday, 
so that's still pretty fresh.

783
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:36,588
Loki. Loki's alive. 
Can you believe it?

784
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:37,923
He's up there.

785
00:53:38,131 --> 00:53:40,050
Loki! Look who it is!

786
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:44,304
Banner, I never thought 
I would say this...

787
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:46,640
but I'm happy to see you.

788
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:49,309
Hulk! Hulk! Hulk!

789
00:53:55,106 --> 00:53:56,107
Banner.

790
00:53:57,234 --> 00:53:58,485
Hey, Banner!

791
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:01,071
No Banner. Only Hulk.

792
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:02,614
What are you doing?

793
00:54:02,697 --> 00:54:04,574
It's me. It's Thor!

794
00:54:25,095 --> 00:54:26,263
Banner, we're friends.

795
00:54:26,346 --> 00:54:28,306
This is crazy. 
I don't want to hurt you!

796
00:54:35,438 --> 00:54:37,274
Here we go.

797
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:57,210
What?

798
00:55:07,762 --> 00:55:09,139
Hey, big guy.

799
00:55:11,099 --> 00:55:12,976
The sun's getting real low.

800
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,614
That's it. 
The sun's going down.

801
00:55:29,743 --> 00:55:31,328
I won't hurt you anymore.

802
00:55:31,745 --> 00:55:32,120
No one will.

803
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,177
Yes! That's how it feels!

804
00:55:48,762 --> 00:55:50,305
I'm just a huge fan 
of the sport.

805
00:55:58,104 --> 00:56:00,440
All right. Screw it.

806
00:56:12,202 --> 00:56:13,328
I know you're in there, Banner.

807
00:56:13,370 --> 00:56:14,370
I'll get you out!

808
00:56:23,755 --> 00:56:25,757
What's the matter with you? 
You're embarrassing me!

809
00:56:25,840 --> 00:56:26,966
I told them we were friends!

810
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:01,311
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

811
00:58:03,104 --> 00:58:07,901
Thunder! Thunder! Thunder!

812
00:58:39,557 --> 00:58:42,185
Another day, another Doug.

813
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,363
What is that noise?

814
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:56,282
The common folk aren't exactly 
falling in line.

815
00:58:56,783 --> 00:59:00,370
There's a resistance trying 
to knock down the front gates.

816
00:59:05,917 --> 00:59:07,669
Tell me about yourself, Skurge.

817
00:59:08,169 --> 00:59:10,380
Well, me dad was a stonemason. 
Me mum was...

818
00:59:10,630 --> 00:59:12,548
Right, yeah, 
I'll just stop you there.

819
00:59:12,632 --> 00:59:14,384
What I meant was...

820
00:59:14,884 --> 00:59:16,177
what's your ambition?

821
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:20,723
I just want a chance 
to prove myself.

822
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:22,475
Recognition.

823
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:24,102
When I was young...

824
00:59:24,519 --> 00:59:28,022
every great king 
had an executioner.

825
00:59:28,314 --> 00:59:30,233
Not just to execute people...

826
00:59:30,525 --> 00:59:32,986
but also 
to execute their vision.

827
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:36,781
But mainly to execute people.

828
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,992
Still, it was a great honor.

829
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,538
I was Odin's executioner.

830
00:59:44,831 --> 00:59:48,918
And you shall be my executioner.

831
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,426
Let's begin our conquest.

832
01:00:07,937 --> 01:00:09,355
Skurge, where's the sword?

833
01:00:14,777 --> 01:00:18,489
That sword is the key 
to opening the Bifrost.

834
01:00:19,073 --> 01:00:20,450
Those people you mentioned,

835
01:00:20,533 --> 01:00:22,535
the ones who aren't 
falling into line...

836
01:00:23,202 --> 01:00:24,287
round them up.

837
01:00:48,227 --> 01:00:49,645
Excuse me.

838
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,159
Sorry about that.

839
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,619
These bloody things 
are everywhere.

840
01:01:05,995 --> 01:01:06,120
Come on.

841
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,533
You'll be safe here.

842
01:02:53,019 --> 01:02:54,020
Are we cool?

843
01:02:57,899 --> 01:02:59,317
It's Hulk in a hot tub.

844
01:03:00,818 --> 01:03:02,236
So how long 
have you been like that?

845
01:03:02,862 --> 01:03:03,905
Like what?

846
01:03:04,530 --> 01:03:07,825
Like this. Big, and green, 
and stupid.

847
01:03:09,202 --> 01:03:11,120
Hulk always Hulk.

848
01:03:16,125 --> 01:03:17,293
How'd you get here?

849
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:19,212
Winning.

850
01:03:19,295 --> 01:03:20,880
You mean cheating?

851
01:03:20,963 --> 01:03:23,299
Were they wearing one of these 
when you won?

852
01:03:23,549 --> 01:03:24,717
How'd you arrive here?

853
01:03:27,720 --> 01:03:28,721
Quinjet.

854
01:03:29,096 --> 01:03:31,432
Yes. Now, 
where is the Quinjet now?

855
01:03:36,395 --> 01:03:38,272
That's naked.

856
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,150
He's very naked.

857
01:03:44,028 --> 01:03:45,947
It's in my brain now.

858
01:03:46,781 --> 01:03:47,782
Quinjet.

859
01:03:58,709 --> 01:03:59,794
Yes!

860
01:04:00,169 --> 01:04:01,420
I'm getting us out of here.

861
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:04,048
This is a terrible, awful place.

862
01:04:04,298 --> 01:04:07,927
You're gonna love Asgard. 
It's big. It's golden. Shiny.

863
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:09,470
Hulk stay.

864
01:04:09,804 --> 01:04:13,015
No, no, no. My people need me 
to get back to Asgard.

865
01:04:13,891 --> 01:04:15,560
We must prevent Ragnarok.

866
01:04:15,893 --> 01:04:16,978
Ragnarok?

867
01:04:17,395 --> 01:04:18,854
The prophesied death 
of my home world.

868
01:04:18,938 --> 01:04:20,314
The end of days, 
it's the end of...

869
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,652
If you help me 
get back to Asgard...

870
01:04:24,944 --> 01:04:26,904
I can help you 
get back to Earth.

871
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:28,197
Earth hate Hulk.

872
01:04:28,489 --> 01:04:29,824
Earth loves Hulk. 
They love you.

873
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,409
You're one of the Avengers.

874
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:32,910
One of the team, 
one of our friends.

875
01:04:33,327 --> 01:04:35,246
This is what friends do. 
They support each other.

876
01:04:35,454 --> 01:04:36,539
You're Banner's friend.

877
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:38,874
I'm not Banner's friend. 
I prefer you.

878
01:04:39,208 --> 01:04:40,209
Banner's friend.

879
01:04:40,293 --> 01:04:41,294
I don't even like Banner.

880
01:04:41,419 --> 01:04:44,213
"I'm into numbers and science 
and stuff."

881
01:04:44,755 --> 01:04:46,173
Thor go. Hulk stay.

882
01:04:46,591 --> 01:04:47,592
Fine.

883
01:04:48,175 --> 01:04:49,176
Stay here.

884
01:04:50,052 --> 01:04:52,388
Stupid place. 
It's hideous, by the way.

885
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,017
The red, the white. 
Just pick a color. Ridiculous.

886
01:04:56,976 --> 01:04:58,060
Smash you.

887
01:04:58,352 --> 01:05:00,521
You didn't smash anything. 
I won that fight.

888
01:05:00,813 --> 01:05:02,815
- I smashed you. 
- Yeah, sure, sure.

889
01:05:03,107 --> 01:05:04,734
- Baby arms. 
- What?

890
01:05:05,026 --> 01:05:06,193
Baby.

891
01:05:06,277 --> 01:05:07,695
Moron! You big child.

892
01:05:07,987 --> 01:05:09,071
Thor go!

893
01:05:09,155 --> 01:05:10,906
I am going.

894
01:05:15,036 --> 01:05:16,287
Thor go again.

895
01:05:21,167 --> 01:05:22,335
Thor home.

896
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:33,930
Hulk trains.

897
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,182
That's great. Have fun.

898
01:05:36,557 --> 01:05:38,100
- Hey, big guy. 
- Angry girl.

899
01:05:38,225 --> 01:05:39,393
What have you been up to?

900
01:05:39,727 --> 01:05:40,728
Winning.

901
01:05:51,238 --> 01:05:54,325
Heimdall, I know you can see me.

902
01:05:55,743 --> 01:05:57,453
<i>I need you to help me.</i>

903
01:05:59,914 --> 01:06:00,915
Help me see.

904
01:06:11,425 --> 01:06:13,761
I see you, but you're far away.

905
01:06:14,845 --> 01:06:15,888
What's going on here?

906
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:17,515
Come see for yourself.

907
01:06:20,267 --> 01:06:21,727
I'm providing refuge 
in a stronghold

908
01:06:21,811 --> 01:06:22,812
built by our ancestors.

909
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,565
But if the garrison falls, 
our only escape is Bifrost.

910
01:06:26,857 --> 01:06:28,776
You're talking 
about evacuating Asgard?

911
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,864
We won't last long if we stay.

912
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:35,866
She draws her power from Asgard

913
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,118
and grows stronger every day.

914
01:06:37,368 --> 01:06:38,369
Come on.

915
01:06:42,456 --> 01:06:43,833
Hela is ravenous.

916
01:06:44,125 --> 01:06:45,126
If I let her leave,

917
01:06:45,209 --> 01:06:47,002
she'll consume Nine Realms 
and all the cosmos.

918
01:06:47,336 --> 01:06:48,337
We need you.

919
01:06:48,421 --> 01:06:49,547
I'm working on it. 
But I don't even know

920
01:06:49,588 --> 01:06:50,589
where the hell I am.

921
01:06:51,132 --> 01:06:53,426
You're on a planet surrounded 
by doorways. Go through one.

922
01:06:53,467 --> 01:06:55,261
- Which one? 
- The big one.

923
01:07:24,331 --> 01:07:25,499
Thor sad.

924
01:07:25,958 --> 01:07:27,042
Shut up.

925
01:07:29,420 --> 01:07:30,880
Thor sad.

926
01:07:32,131 --> 01:07:33,758
I'm not sad, you idiot.

927
01:07:34,258 --> 01:07:35,885
I'm pissed off!

928
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,513
Angry. I lost my father.

929
01:07:40,765 --> 01:07:43,225
I lost my hammer.

930
01:07:43,350 --> 01:07:44,977
- You're not even listening. 
- Whining and crying.

931
01:07:45,019 --> 01:07:46,187
Cry like baby.

932
01:07:46,604 --> 01:07:48,064
Don't kick stuff.

933
01:07:49,482 --> 01:07:51,525
You're being 
a really bad friend.

934
01:07:51,817 --> 01:07:52,818
You bad friend!

935
01:07:53,194 --> 01:07:54,487
- You know what we call you? 
- No.

936
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:56,155
We call you the stupid Avenger.

937
01:07:56,530 --> 01:07:58,365
You're tiny Avenger!

938
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,161
What, are you crazy?

939
01:08:02,369 --> 01:08:03,370
Yes.

940
01:08:03,537 --> 01:08:05,915
You know what? 
Earth does hate you.

941
01:08:26,727 --> 01:08:28,687
No.

942
01:08:31,190 --> 01:08:33,734
I'm sorry I said those things.

943
01:08:34,610 --> 01:08:35,861
You're not the stupid Avenger.

944
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,988
Nobody calls you 
the stupid Avenger.

945
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:40,116
It's okay.

946
01:08:40,491 --> 01:08:41,534
You just can't go around 
throwing shields

947
01:08:41,575 --> 01:08:42,743
at people. 
Could have killed me.

948
01:08:42,785 --> 01:08:43,994
I know. I'm sorry.

949
01:08:44,078 --> 01:08:45,746
I just get so angry 
all the time.

950
01:08:45,830 --> 01:08:47,873
Hulk always, always angry.

951
01:08:48,207 --> 01:08:50,417
I know. 
We're the same, you and I.

952
01:08:51,043 --> 01:08:52,586
We're just 
a couple of hot-headed fools.

953
01:08:52,837 --> 01:08:56,549
Yeah, same. Hulk like fire, 
Thor like water.

954
01:08:57,675 --> 01:08:59,260
We're kind of both like fire.

955
01:08:59,552 --> 01:09:01,428
But Hulk like real fire.

956
01:09:02,596 --> 01:09:04,849
Hulk like raging fire.

957
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:07,226
Thor like smoldering fire.

958
01:09:09,854 --> 01:09:11,605
Hulk, I need you 
to do something for me.

959
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:19,655
Angry girl.

960
01:09:27,121 --> 01:09:29,248
What's going on? 
What are you...

961
01:09:38,424 --> 01:09:40,175
You're so thick-headed 
that you can't tell...

962
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:41,802
when someone's hiding 
all the way across

963
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:43,387
the universe and wants 
to be left alone.

964
01:09:43,429 --> 01:09:45,931
- We need to talk. 
- No, you wanna talk to me.

965
01:09:46,807 --> 01:09:47,850
I need her to stay.

966
01:09:48,017 --> 01:09:49,018
Stay?

967
01:09:49,643 --> 01:09:50,644
Block.

968
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:54,064
Stay.

969
01:09:54,148 --> 01:09:55,733
- Please. 
- Please.

970
01:09:58,527 --> 01:09:59,528
All right.

971
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,574
Here's the deal.

972
01:10:04,283 --> 01:10:05,868
I'll listen to you...

973
01:10:06,702 --> 01:10:07,912
till this is empty.

974
01:10:09,538 --> 01:10:11,665
Asgard is in danger and 
people are dying.

975
01:10:11,957 --> 01:10:13,667
We need to get back there. 
I need your help.

976
01:10:15,586 --> 01:10:17,379
Finished. Bye.

977
01:10:19,131 --> 01:10:20,382
Odin is dead.

978
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:25,971
Hela, the Goddess of Death, 
has invaded Asgard.

979
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,391
If Hela's back, 
then Asgard's already lost.

980
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:30,935
I'm going to stop her.

981
01:10:31,936 --> 01:10:32,937
- Alone? 
- Nope.

982
01:10:33,187 --> 01:10:34,396
I'm putting together a team.

983
01:10:34,730 --> 01:10:37,358
It's me, you, and the big guy.

984
01:10:37,858 --> 01:10:39,944
No. No team. Only Hulk.

985
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:41,695
It's me and you.

986
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:43,072
I think it's only you.

987
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,449
Wait. Just listen. 
The Valkyrie are legend.

988
01:10:45,616 --> 01:10:47,952
Elite warriors of Asgard 
sworn to defend the throne.

989
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:49,995
I'm not getting dragged into

990
01:10:50,037 --> 01:10:51,538
another one of Odin's 
family squabbles.

991
01:10:51,789 --> 01:10:53,582
- What's that supposed to mean? 
- Your sister.

992
01:10:53,707 --> 01:10:55,501
Her power comes from Asgard, 
same as yours.

993
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:56,961
When it grew 
beyond Odin's control

994
01:10:57,002 --> 01:10:58,420
she massacred everyone 
in the palace...

995
01:10:58,462 --> 01:10:59,797
and tried to seize the throne.

996
01:11:00,255 --> 01:11:01,840
When she tried 
to escape her banishment...

997
01:11:01,882 --> 01:11:04,176
he sent the Valkyrie in 
to fight her back.

998
01:11:05,803 --> 01:11:07,805
I only survived because...

999
01:11:09,515 --> 01:11:10,933
Look, I already faced her once

1000
01:11:11,016 --> 01:11:12,768
back when I believed 
in the throne...

1001
01:11:13,060 --> 01:11:14,103
and it cost me everything.

1002
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:15,938
That's what's wrong with Asgard.

1003
01:11:16,021 --> 01:11:18,399
The throne, the secrets, 
the whole golden sham.

1004
01:11:18,816 --> 01:11:19,942
I agree.

1005
01:11:20,985 --> 01:11:22,236
Don't get familiar.

1006
01:11:22,861 --> 01:11:24,113
I agree.

1007
01:11:24,405 --> 01:11:25,823
That's why I turned down 
the throne.

1008
01:11:26,073 --> 01:11:27,950
But this isn't about the crown.

1009
01:11:28,033 --> 01:11:29,076
This is about the people.

1010
01:11:29,368 --> 01:11:31,203
They're dying 
and they're your people, too.

1011
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:32,830
Forget it.

1012
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,207
I have.

1013
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:36,542
- Okay. 
- Okay.

1014
01:11:36,792 --> 01:11:37,876
- Good. Great. 
- Great.

1015
01:11:38,085 --> 01:11:39,086
Thank you.

1016
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:40,754
- For what? 
- For this.

1017
01:11:42,464 --> 01:11:44,299
Didn't see that, did you?

1018
01:11:45,968 --> 01:11:47,886
There... That's better.

1019
01:11:49,847 --> 01:11:51,473
You know, go ahead.

1020
01:11:51,765 --> 01:11:56,145
Stay here and enslave people 
for that lunatic.

1021
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:57,688
Keep drinking, keep hiding.

1022
01:11:57,980 --> 01:11:59,064
But me...

1023
01:12:01,275 --> 01:12:02,985
I choose to run 
toward my problems

1024
01:12:03,068 --> 01:12:04,194
and not away from them.

1025
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:06,572
Because that's what...

1026
01:12:11,785 --> 01:12:13,704
Because that's what heroes do.

1027
01:12:25,382 --> 01:12:26,675
Friend stay!

1028
01:12:38,687 --> 01:12:39,855
Yes!

1029
01:12:54,453 --> 01:12:55,454
All right.

1030
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:00,459

- Thor. 
- Yeah.

1067
01:14:45,898 --> 01:14:47,149
What happened to your hair?

1068
01:14:47,399 --> 01:14:48,650
Some creepy old man cut it off.

1069
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:50,194
- It looks good. 
- Thanks.

1070
01:14:50,486 --> 01:14:52,613
Where are we? How's Nat?

1071
01:14:53,197 --> 01:14:55,824
- Nat is good, I'm sure. 
- Is she okay?

1072
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:57,826
- And what about Sokovia? 
- Sokovia?

1073
01:14:58,118 --> 01:14:59,453
The city, Sokovia. 
Did we save it?

1074
01:14:59,786 --> 01:15:00,829
- Banner, listen. 
- What?

1075
01:15:01,079 --> 01:15:02,956
Sokovia. Ultron. 
That was two years ago.

1076
01:15:03,290 --> 01:15:04,666
- What are you saying? 
- Well...

1077
01:15:04,917 --> 01:15:05,918
What?

1078
01:15:06,835 --> 01:15:08,086
I've been Hulk for two years?

1079
01:15:08,587 --> 01:15:09,838
I'm afraid so.

1080
01:15:16,053 --> 01:15:17,054
What the hell happened?

1081
01:15:20,766 --> 01:15:22,392
Banner, there's something 
you should know.

1082
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:25,896
<i>Voice activation required.</i>

1083
01:15:25,979 --> 01:15:26,980
Banner.

1084
01:15:27,189 --> 01:15:28,607
<i>Welcome, strongest Avenger.</i>

1085
01:15:28,815 --> 01:15:29,816
What?

1086
01:15:29,900 --> 01:15:30,901
Ship's log.

1087
01:15:42,454 --> 01:15:43,914
Thor, where are we?

1088
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,207
Yeah, about that.

1089
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:46,625
<i>Sakaar, hear ye.</i>

1090
01:15:46,708 --> 01:15:48,418
<i>Attention please. 
I have some bad news.</i>

1091
01:15:48,669 --> 01:15:51,338
<i>My beloved exalted champion 
has turned up missing.</i>

1092
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:53,799
<i>Take to the streets. 
Celebrate my champion.</i>

1093
01:15:53,882 --> 01:15:54,883
Who's that?

1094
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:56,718
He kind of runs the place.

1095
01:15:57,636 --> 01:15:58,929
You actually lived 
at his house for awhile.

1096
01:15:58,971 --> 01:15:59,972
- I did? 
- Yeah.

1097
01:16:00,347 --> 01:16:02,516
Quite a lot's happened. You 
and I had a fight recently.

1098
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,601
- Did I win? 
- No, I won. Easily.

1099
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:06,061
Doesn't sound right.

1100
01:16:06,144 --> 01:16:07,145
Well, it's true.

1101
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:09,273
<i>It seems that that 
criminally seductive</i>

1102
01:16:09,356 --> 01:16:11,692
<i>Lord of Thunder 
has stolen him away.</i>

1103
01:16:12,067 --> 01:16:14,361
Seductive God of Thunder. 
We need to move.

1104
01:16:15,320 --> 01:16:16,321
No.

1105
01:16:18,198 --> 01:16:19,283
This is bad.

1106
01:16:19,491 --> 01:16:21,326
This is really, really bad.

1107
01:16:24,288 --> 01:16:27,749
Thor, I think I'm freaking out.

1108
01:16:28,292 --> 01:16:29,334
No, no, no.

1109
01:16:29,501 --> 01:16:31,336
Don't freak out. You're okay. 
Put these on.

1110
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,629
These are Tony's clothes.

1111
01:16:32,796 --> 01:16:34,047
- I know, come on. 
- Is he here?

1112
01:16:34,298 --> 01:16:36,258
No, he's not here. But listen. 
Just stay calm, okay?

1113
01:16:36,300 --> 01:16:38,385
The sun's going down. 
The sun's getting really low.

1114
01:16:38,468 --> 01:16:39,469
Sun's going down.

1115
01:16:47,269 --> 01:16:49,062
I'm upset!

1116
01:16:52,149 --> 01:16:53,942
I'm very upset.

1117
01:16:54,234 --> 01:16:56,194
You know what I like about 
being upset? The blame.

1118
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:58,530
Right now, that's 
the mindset that I'm in.

1119
01:16:58,614 --> 01:16:59,781
And you know who I'm blaming?

1120
01:16:59,990 --> 01:17:01,366
- Grandmaster, I can... 
- Hey!

1121
01:17:01,533 --> 01:17:02,534
Don't interrupt me!

1122
01:17:02,743 --> 01:17:03,744
Here you go.

1123
01:17:04,661 --> 01:17:06,121
Why are you handing me 
the melt stick?

1124
01:17:06,204 --> 01:17:07,831
He was interrupting.

1125
01:17:08,206 --> 01:17:09,875
That's not a capital violation.

1126
01:17:10,167 --> 01:17:11,335
Where was I?

1127
01:17:11,877 --> 01:17:14,212
My precious champion 
has come up missing...

1128
01:17:14,504 --> 01:17:16,465
and it's all because 
of that Lord of Thunder.

1129
01:17:16,548 --> 01:17:18,717
It's all because of him. 
Your brother.

1130
01:17:19,009 --> 01:17:21,845
Whatever the story is. 
Adopted, or complicated.

1131
01:17:22,012 --> 01:17:23,221
I'm sure there's a big history.

1132
01:17:23,263 --> 01:17:24,264
And your contender...

1133
01:17:25,015 --> 01:17:26,016
My dear friend...

1134
01:17:26,433 --> 01:17:28,143
if you were to give me 12 hours,

1135
01:17:28,226 --> 01:17:29,811
I could bring them both 
back to you. Alive.

1136
01:17:29,853 --> 01:17:31,271
I could do it in two.

1137
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:33,273
I could do it in one.

1138
01:17:33,523 --> 01:17:34,524
Let's stop there.

1139
01:17:34,733 --> 01:17:36,443
You know what? 
I woke up this morning

1140
01:17:36,526 --> 01:17:38,236
thinking about 
a public execution.

1141
01:17:39,279 --> 01:17:40,572
But for now, I'll settle 
for this sweet little...

1142
01:17:40,614 --> 01:17:43,325
"Who's gonna get him first?"

1143
01:17:44,409 --> 01:17:46,912
So, you're on the clock.

1144
01:17:48,914 --> 01:17:49,081
What have you done?

1145
01:17:50,082 --> 01:17:51,333
I don't answer to you, lackey.

1146
01:17:51,458 --> 01:17:52,459
It's Loki.

1147
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:54,169
And you will answer 
to the Grandmaster.

1148
01:17:57,422 --> 01:18:00,133
Why would you help my brother 
escape with that green fool?

1149
01:18:00,550 --> 01:18:01,677
I don't help anyone.

1150
01:18:08,350 --> 01:18:09,351
You're a Valkyrie.

1151
01:18:14,439 --> 01:18:16,483
I thought the Valkyrie had 
all died gruesome deaths.

1152
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,361
Choose your next words wisely.

1153
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,781
I'm terribly sorry. 
Must be a very painful memory.

1154
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:18,086
The sun's going down. 
It's getting really low.

1155
01:19:19,421 --> 01:19:20,630
The sun's going down.

1156
01:19:20,714 --> 01:19:22,132
- It's getting real low. 
- Shoot.

1157
01:19:22,507 --> 01:19:24,718
- Sun's getting low. 
- Would you stop saying that?

1158
01:19:24,801 --> 01:19:25,969
I just need you to stay calm.

1159
01:19:26,094 --> 01:19:27,929
Calm? I'm on an alien planet!

1160
01:19:28,221 --> 01:19:29,890
It's just a planet. You've 
been on a planet before.

1161
01:19:29,931 --> 01:19:30,974
Yeah. One.

1162
01:19:31,308 --> 01:19:33,018
Now you've been on two. 
That's a good thing.

1163
01:19:33,143 --> 01:19:34,269
It's a new experience.

1164
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:36,396
My neurons, 
they're firing faster

1165
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:38,482
than my brain can handle 
the information.

1166
01:19:38,732 --> 01:19:40,901
The whole thing is totally 
different this time.

1167
01:19:41,193 --> 01:19:42,903
In the past, I always felt 
like Hulk and I

1168
01:19:42,986 --> 01:19:44,279
each had a hand on the wheel.

1169
01:19:44,654 --> 01:19:46,323
But this time, it's like 
he had the keys

1170
01:19:46,406 --> 01:19:47,991
to the car and I was 
locked in the trunk.

1171
01:19:48,200 --> 01:19:50,160
All right, well, you're back 
now. That's all that matters.

1172
01:19:50,202 --> 01:19:51,244
No, it's not what matters.

1173
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,537
What I'm trying 
to tell you, is that

1174
01:19:52,579 --> 01:19:54,122
if I turn into the Hulk again...

1175
01:19:54,372 --> 01:19:55,749
Banner may never come back.

1176
01:19:56,041 --> 01:19:57,250
And we're stranded on a planet

1177
01:19:57,334 --> 01:19:59,085
that is designed 
to stress me out.

1178
01:19:59,169 --> 01:20:00,295
We're not stranded.

1179
01:20:00,378 --> 01:20:02,005
I'm gonna figure out a way 
to get us home.

1180
01:20:02,255 --> 01:20:03,256
Thank you.

1181
01:20:03,590 --> 01:20:05,592
Not your home, though. Asgard. 
My home.

1182
01:20:05,926 --> 01:20:06,968
What?

1183
01:20:07,219 --> 01:20:08,804
Listen, my people 
are in great danger.

1184
01:20:09,387 --> 01:20:11,640
You and I, we have to fight 
this really powerful being...

1185
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:13,558
who also happens 
to be my sister.

1186
01:20:13,808 --> 01:20:15,477
Okay, that is so wrong 
on so many...

1187
01:20:15,685 --> 01:20:16,812
I don't wanna fight your sister.

1188
01:20:16,853 --> 01:20:18,104
That's a family issue.

1189
01:20:18,230 --> 01:20:19,481
No, she's an evil being.

1190
01:20:19,564 --> 01:20:21,358
I don't care what she is.

1191
01:20:21,441 --> 01:20:23,610
I'm not fighting any 
more beings. I'm sick of it.

1192
01:20:23,860 --> 01:20:24,861
- What? 
- I just told you.

1193
01:20:25,195 --> 01:20:26,696
If I turn into the Hulk,

1194
01:20:26,780 --> 01:20:28,073
I am never gonna 
come back again.

1195
01:20:28,156 --> 01:20:29,199
And you don't care.

1196
01:20:29,366 --> 01:20:31,076
No, no. I'm putting together 
the team.

1197
01:20:31,368 --> 01:20:32,577
The Hulk is the fire.

1198
01:20:32,869 --> 01:20:34,663
Wait, you're just using me 
to get to the Hulk.

1199
01:20:34,788 --> 01:20:36,206
- What? No! 
- It's gross.

1200
01:20:36,456 --> 01:20:38,250
You don't care about me. 
You're not my friend.

1201
01:20:38,500 --> 01:20:40,126
No! I don't even 
like the Hulk.

1202
01:20:40,210 --> 01:20:41,461
He's all like...

1203
01:20:41,628 --> 01:20:43,046
"Smash, smash, smash."

1204
01:20:43,296 --> 01:20:44,297
I prefer you.

1205
01:20:45,215 --> 01:20:46,216
Thanks.

1206
01:20:47,092 --> 01:20:48,593
But if I'm being honest,

1207
01:20:48,677 --> 01:20:50,220
when it comes 
to fighting evil beings...

1208
01:20:50,303 --> 01:20:51,596
he is very powerful and useful.

1209
01:20:51,930 --> 01:20:53,723
Yeah, Banner's powerful 
and useful, too.

1210
01:20:54,015 --> 01:20:55,100
Is he though?

1211
01:20:55,392 --> 01:20:57,394
How many PhDs 
does Hulk have? Zero.

1212
01:20:57,602 --> 01:20:59,354
How many PhDs does 
Banner have? Seven.

1213
01:21:00,313 --> 01:21:02,190
Fine, you don't have 
to fight anyone.

1214
01:21:02,440 --> 01:21:04,234
But we're in danger here, 
so we have to move.

1215
01:21:08,363 --> 01:21:09,531
What are you doing with that?

1216
01:21:09,573 --> 01:21:10,615
I need a disguise. 
I'm a fugitive.

1217
01:21:10,657 --> 01:21:12,367
- I need a disguise. 
- You are the disguise.

1218
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:14,661
- I'll be Tony Stark. 
- What?

1219
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:16,621
Yeah. Tony and the gypsy.

1220
01:21:16,955 --> 01:21:19,332
No, no, you're not Tony. 
You're Bruce. Bruce Banner.

1221
01:21:19,583 --> 01:21:21,001
Then why did you dress me up 
like Tony?

1222
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:22,043
Because you were naked.

1223
01:21:22,210 --> 01:21:23,336
Okay, I'll give you that.

1224
01:21:24,254 --> 01:21:25,505
What are you doing? 
Stop doing that!

1225
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:26,923
Tony wears his pants 
super tight.

1226
01:21:27,007 --> 01:21:28,008
- Stop it! 
- I'm sorry.

1227
01:21:28,341 --> 01:21:30,343
- Why are you being so weird? 
- I don't know.

1228
01:21:30,635 --> 01:21:32,888
Maybe the fact that I was 
trapped for two years...

1229
01:21:33,096 --> 01:21:35,515
inside of a monster 
made me a little weird.

1230
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:37,434
Hey. It's okay.

1231
01:21:37,684 --> 01:21:39,978
You're good. Calm down. 
Come on.

1232
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,605
Listen, we're gonna 
go to Asgard...

1233
01:21:41,771 --> 01:21:42,814
and you're not gonna 
have to think about

1234
01:21:42,856 --> 01:21:43,857
the Hulk ever again.

1235
01:21:44,149 --> 01:21:45,191
- All right? 
- All right.

1236
01:21:49,279 --> 01:21:50,947
Hulk!

1237
01:21:52,907 --> 01:21:54,492
This is bad.

1238
01:21:58,663 --> 01:21:59,080
Banner! Banner!

1239
01:22:04,044 --> 01:22:05,086
Banner!

1240
01:22:18,767 --> 01:22:19,809
Banner!

1241
01:22:20,352 --> 01:22:21,478
Thor!

1242
01:22:32,781 --> 01:22:33,782
Hi.

1243
01:22:34,074 --> 01:22:35,075
Hi.

1244
01:22:35,325 --> 01:22:36,576
I was gonna do that.

1245
01:22:36,660 --> 01:22:37,786
Yeah, well, I did it first.

1246
01:22:38,161 --> 01:22:39,955
That's good. 
What are you doing here?

1247
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,749
What are you doing here? 
I thought you were leaving.

1248
01:22:42,791 --> 01:22:43,792
I got sidetracked.

1249
01:22:44,250 --> 01:22:45,251
What's with the...

1250
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:46,836
It's my disguise.

1251
01:22:47,003 --> 01:22:48,004
But I can see your face.

1252
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:50,090
Not when I do this, you can't.

1253
01:22:50,882 --> 01:22:52,676
Your hair looks nice. 
I like what you did with it.

1254
01:22:52,717 --> 01:22:54,135
Change it? Washed it maybe?

1255
01:23:00,350 --> 01:23:01,643
What are those things 
on her eyes?

1256
01:23:01,685 --> 01:23:03,186
Are those the people 
that she's killed?

1257
01:23:03,269 --> 01:23:04,980
She's so beautiful and strong 
and courageous.

1258
01:23:05,021 --> 01:23:06,022
Who is this guy?

1259
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,148
- He's a friend. 
- Who? Me?

1260
01:23:07,190 --> 01:23:08,650
- I'm Bruce. 
- I feel like I know you.

1261
01:23:08,775 --> 01:23:10,694
I feel like I know you, too.

1262
01:23:15,365 --> 01:23:17,242
Look, I've spent years 
in a haze,

1263
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:18,702
trying to forget my past.

1264
01:23:19,244 --> 01:23:20,537
Sakaar seemed like 
the best place

1265
01:23:20,620 --> 01:23:22,872
to drink and forget, 
and to die one day.

1266
01:23:23,248 --> 01:23:24,874
I was thinking 
that you drink too much,

1267
01:23:24,958 --> 01:23:26,376
and that probably 
was gonna kill you.

1268
01:23:26,501 --> 01:23:27,711
I don't plan to stop drinking.

1269
01:23:27,752 --> 01:23:29,963
But I don't wanna forget.

1270
01:23:30,213 --> 01:23:31,756
I can't turn away anymore...

1271
01:23:32,507 --> 01:23:34,175
so if I'm gonna die...

1272
01:23:34,467 --> 01:23:36,052
well, it may as well be 
driving my sword

1273
01:23:36,136 --> 01:23:37,679
through the heart 
of that murderous hag.

1274
01:23:37,804 --> 01:23:39,264
- Good. 
- Yeah.

1275
01:23:39,556 --> 01:23:42,434
So, I'm saying 
that I wanna be on the team.

1276
01:23:43,143 --> 01:23:44,352
Has it got a name?

1277
01:23:44,561 --> 01:23:47,230
Yeah, it's called the Revengers.

1278
01:23:47,605 --> 01:23:48,606
Revengers?

1279
01:23:48,690 --> 01:23:51,067
Because I'm getting revenge. 
You're getting revenge.

1280
01:23:52,944 --> 01:23:54,237
Do you want revenge?

1281
01:23:54,404 --> 01:23:56,531
I'm undecided.

1282
01:23:56,823 --> 01:23:57,824
Okay.

1283
01:23:58,491 --> 01:24:00,201
Also, I've got a peace offering.

1284
01:24:03,496 --> 01:24:05,331
Surprise.

1285
01:24:12,464 --> 01:24:13,798
Just had to be sure.

1286
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:18,595
Hello, Bruce.

1287
01:24:20,013 --> 01:24:21,765
So, last time I saw you,

1288
01:24:21,848 --> 01:24:23,183
you were trying 
to kill everybody.

1289
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:24,392
Where are you at these days?

1290
01:24:24,934 --> 01:24:26,644
It varies from moment to moment.

1291
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:28,938
Is that a Dragonfang?

1292
01:24:29,606 --> 01:24:30,690
It is.

1293
01:24:30,774 --> 01:24:31,816
My God.

1294
01:24:32,901 --> 01:24:34,861
This is the famed sword 
of the Valkyrie.

1295
01:24:34,944 --> 01:24:36,780
Sakaar and Asgard 
are about as far apart

1296
01:24:36,863 --> 01:24:38,031
as any two known systems.

1297
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:41,034
Our best bet is a wormhole 
just outside of city limits.

1298
01:24:41,451 --> 01:24:43,328
Refuel on Xandar, and 
we can be back in Asgard

1299
01:24:43,411 --> 01:24:44,871
in 18 months.

1300
01:24:45,163 --> 01:24:48,291
Nope. We are going through 
the big one.

1301
01:24:48,541 --> 01:24:49,542
The Devil's Anus?

1302
01:24:49,918 --> 01:24:50,919
Anus?

1303
01:24:51,085 --> 01:24:52,253
Wait, wait, wait. Whose anus?

1304
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:53,338
For the record, I didn't know

1305
01:24:53,379 --> 01:24:54,422
it was called that 
when I picked it.

1306
01:24:54,464 --> 01:24:56,090
That looks like 
a collapsing neutron star...

1307
01:24:56,132 --> 01:24:58,551
inside of an 
Einstein-Rosen Bridge.

1308
01:24:58,968 --> 01:25:00,136
We need another ship.

1309
01:25:00,220 --> 01:25:01,638
That would tear mine to pieces.

1310
01:25:01,930 --> 01:25:03,515
She's right. We need one 
that can withstand

1311
01:25:03,556 --> 01:25:04,891
the geodetic strain 
from the singularity.

1312
01:25:04,933 --> 01:25:06,768
And has an offline 
power steering system...

1313
01:25:06,851 --> 01:25:09,479
that could also function 
without the on-board computer.

1314
01:25:09,771 --> 01:25:11,064
And we need one 
with cup holders,

1315
01:25:11,147 --> 01:25:12,690
because we're gonna die. 
So, drinks!

1316
01:25:13,066 --> 01:25:14,859
Do I know you? 
I feel like I know you.

1317
01:25:15,110 --> 01:25:16,861
I feel like I know you, too. 
It's weird.

1318
01:25:17,112 --> 01:25:18,112
What do you say?

1319
01:25:18,446 --> 01:25:19,489
Uncharted metagalactic travel

1320
01:25:19,531 --> 01:25:20,865
through a volatile 
cosmic gateway.

1321
01:25:21,074 --> 01:25:22,158
Talk about an adventure.

1322
01:25:22,909 --> 01:25:24,452
- We need a ship. 
- Need a ship.

1323
01:25:24,702 --> 01:25:25,745
There are one or two ships.

1324
01:25:25,787 --> 01:25:26,913
Absolute top of the line 
models...

1325
01:25:26,955 --> 01:25:28,248
I don't mean to impose...

1326
01:25:31,709 --> 01:25:33,378
But the Grandmaster 
has a great many ships.

1327
01:25:33,962 --> 01:25:35,338
I may even have stolen

1328
01:25:35,421 --> 01:25:37,382
the access codes 
to his security system.

1329
01:25:37,674 --> 01:25:38,716
And suddenly you're overcome

1330
01:25:38,758 --> 01:25:40,093
with an urge 
to do the right thing.

1331
01:25:40,134 --> 01:25:41,135
Heavens, no.

1332
01:25:41,219 --> 01:25:42,887
I've run out of favor 
with the Grandmaster...

1333
01:25:42,929 --> 01:25:44,848
and in exchange for codes 
and access to a ship...

1334
01:25:45,056 --> 01:25:48,101
I'm asking for safe passage 
through the Anus.

1335
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:49,853
You're telling us 
that you can get us

1336
01:25:49,894 --> 01:25:51,020
access into the garage...

1337
01:25:51,104 --> 01:25:52,730
without setting off any alarms?

1338
01:25:53,189 --> 01:25:54,732
Yes, brother. I can.

1339
01:25:54,983 --> 01:25:57,652
Okay, can I just... 
A quick FYI.

1340
01:25:57,944 --> 01:25:59,737
I was just talking to him 
just a couple minutes ago...

1341
01:25:59,779 --> 01:26:02,156
and he was totally ready 
to kill any of us.

1342
01:26:02,407 --> 01:26:03,491
He did try to kill me.

1343
01:26:03,783 --> 01:26:05,493
Yes, me too. 
On many, many occasions.

1344
01:26:05,785 --> 01:26:07,453
There was one time 
when we were children...

1345
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:08,955
he transformed himself 
into a snake,

1346
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:10,331
and he knows that I love snakes.

1347
01:26:10,415 --> 01:26:12,250
So, I went to pick up 
the snake to admire it...

1348
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,835
and he transformed back 
into himself

1349
01:26:13,918 --> 01:26:15,211
and he was like, 
"Yeah, it's me!"

1350
01:26:15,295 --> 01:26:18,173
And he stabbed me. 
We were eight at the time.

1351
01:26:18,798 --> 01:26:19,883
If we're boosting a ship...

1352
01:26:20,049 --> 01:26:21,759
we're gonna need to draw some 
guards away from the palace.

1353
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:23,094
Why not set the beast loose?

1354
01:26:23,303 --> 01:26:24,304
Shut up.

1355
01:26:24,554 --> 01:26:25,555
You guys have a beast?

1356
01:26:25,763 --> 01:26:28,057
No, there's no beast. 
He's just being stupid.

1357
01:26:28,391 --> 01:26:29,767
We're going to start 
a revolution.

1358
01:26:29,851 --> 01:26:31,311
- Revolution? 
- I'll explain later.

1359
01:26:31,895 --> 01:26:34,063
- Who's this guy again? 
- I'll explain later.

1360
01:26:35,273 --> 01:26:37,400
Is that some sort of protoplasm,

1361
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:38,735
all the stuff 
that's coming out of you...

1362
01:26:38,776 --> 01:26:39,944
or are they eggs?

1363
01:26:41,446 --> 01:26:42,572
Looks like eggs.

1364
01:26:52,123 --> 01:26:53,333
I'm looking for Korg.

1365
01:26:53,708 --> 01:26:54,876
Who's asking?

1366
01:26:55,126 --> 01:26:56,210
I know you're asking.

1367
01:26:56,502 --> 01:26:58,379
Is anyone else asking, 
or is it just you?

1368
01:26:58,713 --> 01:27:00,673
The Lord of Thunder 
sends his best.

1369
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:06,346
The revolution has begun.

1370
01:27:06,679 --> 01:27:08,598
Revolution? 
How did this happen?

1371
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,308
Don't know.

1372
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:11,976
But the arena's mainframe

1373
01:27:12,060 --> 01:27:13,853
for the Obedience Disks 
have been deactivated...

1374
01:27:13,895 --> 01:27:15,813
and the slaves 
have armed themselves.

1375
01:27:15,980 --> 01:27:17,941
I don't like that word.

1376
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:19,400
Which? Mainframe?

1377
01:27:19,651 --> 01:27:21,653
No. Why would I not like 
"mainframe"?

1378
01:27:21,903 --> 01:27:23,863
No, the "S" word.

1379
01:27:24,113 --> 01:27:26,658
Sorry, the prisoners with jobs 
have armed themselves.

1380
01:27:28,201 --> 01:27:29,410
Okay, that's better.

1381
01:27:35,708 --> 01:27:37,418
Hey, so, listen. 
We should talk.

1382
01:27:38,878 --> 01:27:39,921
I disagree.

1383
01:27:40,421 --> 01:27:43,216
Open communication 
was never our family's forte.

1384
01:27:43,591 --> 01:27:44,592
You have no idea.

1385
01:27:44,759 --> 01:27:47,345
Been quite the revelation 
since we last spoke.

1386
01:27:47,428 --> 01:27:48,429
Hello.

1387
01:27:49,514 --> 01:27:50,515
Hi.

1388
01:27:57,605 --> 01:27:59,148
Odin brought us together.

1389
01:28:00,233 --> 01:28:03,027
It's almost poetic that his 
death should split us apart.

1390
01:28:09,158 --> 01:28:11,160
We might as well be 
strangers now.

1391
01:28:11,411 --> 01:28:14,372
Two sons of the crown, 
set adrift.

1392
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:19,127
Thought you didn't 
wanna talk about it.

1393
01:28:20,545 --> 01:28:21,546
Here's the thing.

1394
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:23,756
I'm probably better off 
staying here on Sakaar.

1395
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,425
That's exactly 
what I was thinking.

1396
01:28:27,468 --> 01:28:28,761
Did you just agree with me?

1397
01:28:29,053 --> 01:28:30,555
Come on, this place 
is perfect for you.

1398
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:32,390
It's savage, chaotic, lawless...

1399
01:28:32,598 --> 01:28:34,183
Brother, you're gonna do 
great here.

1400
01:28:34,434 --> 01:28:36,019
Do you truly think 
so little of me?

1401
01:28:38,271 --> 01:28:39,897
Loki, I thought 
the world of you.

1402
01:28:41,107 --> 01:28:43,568
I thought we were gonna fight 
side by side forever.

1403
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:46,571
But at the end of the day, 
you're you and I'm me.

1404
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:49,741
I don't know, maybe 
there's still good in you.

1405
01:28:49,991 --> 01:28:51,159
But let's be honest,

1406
01:28:51,242 --> 01:28:53,411
our paths diverged 
a long time ago.

1407
01:28:58,207 --> 01:28:59,208
Yeah.

1408
01:29:00,418 --> 01:29:01,461
It's probably for the best

1409
01:29:01,544 --> 01:29:02,920
that we never 
see each other again.

1410
01:29:02,962 --> 01:29:04,172
That's what you always wanted.

1411
01:29:08,468 --> 01:29:10,053
Hey, let's do "Get Help."

1412
01:29:10,303 --> 01:29:11,304
- What? 
- "Get Help."

1413
01:29:11,387 --> 01:29:12,388
No.

1414
01:29:12,472 --> 01:29:13,514
- Come on, you love it. 
- I hate it.

1415
01:29:13,556 --> 01:29:14,599
It's great. 
It works every time.

1416
01:29:14,640 --> 01:29:16,309
- It's humiliating. 
- Do you have a better plan?

1417
01:29:16,351 --> 01:29:17,894
- No. 
- We're doing it.

1418
01:29:18,061 --> 01:29:19,729
We are not doing "Get Help."

1419
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:22,023
Get help! Please!

1420
01:29:22,273 --> 01:29:23,274
My brother, he's dying.

1421
01:29:23,483 --> 01:29:25,401
Get help! Help him!

1422
01:29:27,570 --> 01:29:28,696
Classic.

1423
01:29:28,863 --> 01:29:30,198
Still hate it.

1424
01:29:30,406 --> 01:29:32,658
- It's humiliating. 
- Not for me, it's not.

1425
01:29:32,909 --> 01:29:34,952
Now, which one's the ship 
she told us to get?

1426
01:29:35,036 --> 01:29:36,037
<i>The Commodore.</i>

1427
01:29:36,954 --> 01:29:37,955
Right.

1428
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:43,211
Though I feel it won't make 
much of a difference.

1429
01:29:45,463 --> 01:29:47,131
Loki.

1430
01:29:48,383 --> 01:29:49,842
I know I've betrayed you 
many times before...

1431
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:51,511
but this time 
it's truly nothing personal.

1432
01:29:51,761 --> 01:29:53,554
The reward for your capture

1433
01:29:53,638 --> 01:29:54,722
will set me up nicely.

1434
01:29:55,014 --> 01:29:56,432
Never one for sentiment, 
were you?

1435
01:29:56,808 --> 01:29:58,059
Easier to let it burn.

1436
01:29:58,393 --> 01:29:59,393
I agree.

1437
01:30:08,069 --> 01:30:09,570
That looks painful.

1438
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:13,032
Dear brother, 
you're becoming predictable.

1439
01:30:13,407 --> 01:30:15,201
I trust you, you betray me.

1440
01:30:15,535 --> 01:30:17,453
Round and round 
in circles we go.

1441
01:30:17,745 --> 01:30:19,622
See, Loki, life is about, 
it's about growth.

1442
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:21,040
It's about change.

1443
01:30:21,290 --> 01:30:24,252
But you seem to 
just wanna stay the same.

1444
01:30:25,044 --> 01:30:26,587
I guess 
what I'm trying to say...

1445
01:30:26,838 --> 01:30:29,674
is that you'll always be 
the God of Mischief...

1446
01:30:29,966 --> 01:30:31,300
but you could be more.

1447
01:30:33,928 --> 01:30:35,847
I'll just put this over here 
for you.

1448
01:30:36,472 --> 01:30:39,809
Anyway, all got places to be, 
so good luck.

1449
01:30:45,273 --> 01:30:46,566
All right, 
I can figure this out.

1450
01:30:46,983 --> 01:30:48,734
It's just another spaceship.

1451
01:31:02,165 --> 01:31:03,458
<i>Loyal Sakaarians...</i>

1452
01:31:03,708 --> 01:31:05,585
<i>Lord of Thunder 
has stolen my ship</i>

1453
01:31:05,668 --> 01:31:07,044
<i>and my favorite champion.</i>

1454
01:31:08,671 --> 01:31:11,757
<i>Sakaarians, take to the skies. 
Bring him down.</i>

1455
01:31:11,966 --> 01:31:13,593
<i>Do not let him 
leave this planet.</i>

1456
01:31:26,814 --> 01:31:28,065
- Good shot! 
- Thanks.

1457
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:32,153
<i>Open the doors.</i>

1458
01:31:32,236 --> 01:31:33,529
Okay.

1459
01:31:38,910 --> 01:31:40,661
I hope that you're tougher 
than you look.

1460
01:31:40,828 --> 01:31:41,871
Why?

1461
01:31:54,425 --> 01:31:56,135
Shouldn't we be shooting back 
or something?

1462
01:31:56,219 --> 01:31:57,220
Yes, we should.

1463
01:32:17,698 --> 01:32:18,991
No!

1464
01:32:21,994 --> 01:32:22,995
- No! 
- No!

1465
01:32:30,002 --> 01:32:31,045
Get inside!

1466
01:32:31,337 --> 01:32:32,755
In a minute.

1467
01:32:44,183 --> 01:32:46,060
I should probably go and help. 
Here, take the wheel.

1468
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:47,687
No. I don't know 
how to fly one of these.

1469
01:32:47,770 --> 01:32:49,522
You're a scientist. 
Use one of your PhDs.

1470
01:32:49,605 --> 01:32:52,817
None of them are for flying 
alien spaceships!

1471
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:28,602
Okay, come on.

1472
01:33:28,686 --> 01:33:30,730
There's gotta be a gun 
on this thing.

1473
01:33:30,855 --> 01:33:31,856
That looks like a gun.

1474
01:33:33,190 --> 01:33:34,483
<i>It's my birthday</i>

1475
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:35,610
<i>It's my birthday</i>

1476
01:33:36,569 --> 01:33:37,570
<i>It's my birthday</i>

1477
01:33:45,620 --> 01:33:46,704
Yeah!

1478
01:34:04,263 --> 01:34:06,349
Guys, we're coming up 
on the Devil's Anus!

1479
01:34:13,147 --> 01:34:14,148
There she is.

1480
01:34:14,440 --> 01:34:16,275
Our ticket out of here.

1481
01:34:16,942 --> 01:34:18,110
Hey, what's this?

1482
01:34:23,157 --> 01:34:24,241
Thank you.

1483
01:34:24,325 --> 01:34:26,827
Hey, man. We're about to jump 
on that ginormous spaceship.

1484
01:34:26,911 --> 01:34:27,912
You wanna come?

1485
01:34:28,287 --> 01:34:30,915
You do seem like

1486
01:34:30,081 --> 01:34:32,500
you're in desperate need 
of leadership.

1487
01:34:32,917 --> 01:34:34,335
Why, thank you.

1488
01:34:38,214 --> 01:34:39,215
Here we go.

1489
01:34:45,763 --> 01:34:46,764
Shit.

1490
01:35:04,323 --> 01:35:06,033
Asgardians...

1491
01:35:06,283 --> 01:35:08,702
some misguided soul...

1492
01:35:09,662 --> 01:35:11,539
has stolen the Bifrost sword.

1493
01:35:11,872 --> 01:35:14,083
Tell us where it is...

1494
01:35:14,375 --> 01:35:16,877
or there will be consequences.

1495
01:35:20,714 --> 01:35:21,841
Bad ones.

1496
01:35:25,177 --> 01:35:26,178
Well?

1497
01:35:33,310 --> 01:35:34,311
You.

1498
01:36:10,556 --> 01:36:14,518
Well? Executioner?

1499
01:36:19,565 --> 01:36:20,775
Wait!

1500
01:36:20,858 --> 01:36:21,859
Wait!

1501
01:36:24,236 --> 01:36:25,404
I know where the sword is.

1502
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,825
I never thought 
I'd be back here.

1503
01:37:14,495 --> 01:37:15,955
I thought it'd be a lot nicer.

1504
01:37:16,497 --> 01:37:17,957
I mean, not that it's not nice.

1505
01:37:18,040 --> 01:37:19,416
It's just, it's on fire.

1506
01:37:19,667 --> 01:37:20,918
Here, up here in the mountains.

1507
01:37:21,126 --> 01:37:23,212
Heat signatures. 
People clustered together.

1508
01:37:23,379 --> 01:37:24,380
She's coming for them.

1509
01:37:24,672 --> 01:37:25,714
Okay, drop me off at the palace

1510
01:37:25,756 --> 01:37:27,883
- and I'll draw her away. 
- And get yourself killed?

1511
01:37:28,092 --> 01:37:29,802
The people trapped down there 
are all that matters.

1512
01:37:29,843 --> 01:37:31,220
While I'm dealing with Hela, 
I need you two

1513
01:37:31,262 --> 01:37:32,555
to help get everyone off Asgard.

1514
01:37:32,805 --> 01:37:34,431
How the hell are we supposed 
to do that?

1515
01:37:35,099 --> 01:37:36,642
I have a man on the ground.

1516
01:37:42,523 --> 01:37:43,524
Asgard.

1517
01:37:47,152 --> 01:37:48,320
She's here.

1518
01:38:00,040 --> 01:38:01,625
Now the ship has a gun.

1519
01:38:01,875 --> 01:38:02,960
I'll take it from here.

1520
01:38:03,919 --> 01:38:06,797
I found this in the armory.

1521
01:38:10,175 --> 01:38:11,176
Good luck.

1522
01:38:12,887 --> 01:38:14,054
Your Majesty...

1523
01:38:16,140 --> 01:38:17,182
don't die.

1524
01:38:20,185 --> 01:38:21,812
You know what I mean.

1525
01:39:20,871 --> 01:39:22,623
We must keep moving!

1526
01:39:23,415 --> 01:39:25,000
Go to the Bifrost!

1527
01:40:07,793 --> 01:40:08,877
Sister.

1528
01:40:11,171 --> 01:40:12,798
You're still alive.

1529
01:40:13,090 --> 01:40:14,967
I love what you've done 
with the place.

1530
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,385
Redecorating, I see.

1531
01:40:16,760 --> 01:40:18,804
It seems our father's solution

1532
01:40:18,887 --> 01:40:21,348
to every problem 
was to cover it up.

1533
01:40:22,975 --> 01:40:24,476
Or to cast it out.

1534
01:40:26,812 --> 01:40:30,232
He told you you were worthy. 
He said the same thing to me.

1535
01:40:30,941 --> 01:40:32,192
You see?

1536
01:40:32,943 --> 01:40:34,987
You never knew him.

1537
01:40:35,404 --> 01:40:37,156
Not at his best.

1538
01:40:37,448 --> 01:40:40,325
Odin and I drowned 
entire civilizations

1539
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:41,910
in blood and tears.

1540
01:40:42,202 --> 01:40:44,079
Where do you think 
all this gold came from?

1541
01:40:45,289 --> 01:40:46,874
And then, one day...

1542
01:40:47,166 --> 01:40:50,044
he decided to become 
a benevolent king.

1543
01:40:50,377 --> 01:40:52,880
To foster peace, 
to protect life...

1544
01:40:54,131 --> 01:40:55,591
to have you.

1545
01:40:56,133 --> 01:40:58,427
I understand why you're angry.

1546
01:40:58,677 --> 01:41:00,137
And you are my sister, 
and technically

1547
01:41:00,220 --> 01:41:02,514
have a claim to the throne.

1548
01:41:02,765 --> 01:41:04,725
And believe me, I would love 
for someone else to rule.

1549
01:41:04,767 --> 01:41:05,893
But it can't be you.

1550
01:41:06,143 --> 01:41:09,646
You're just... 
The worst.

1551
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:12,858
Okay, get up.

1552
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:15,110
You're in my seat.

1553
01:41:16,278 --> 01:41:18,155
You know, Father once told me...

1554
01:41:18,405 --> 01:41:20,866
that a wise king 
never seeks out war.

1555
01:41:21,116 --> 01:41:23,535
But must always be ready for it.

1556
01:41:55,943 --> 01:41:57,194
Go back!

1557
01:42:02,366 --> 01:42:03,617
Go!

1558
01:42:38,777 --> 01:42:41,155
To be honest, I expected more.

1559
01:42:44,408 --> 01:42:45,409
Heimdall!

1560
01:42:47,744 --> 01:42:49,371
The sword!

1561
01:42:53,959 --> 01:42:55,419
Here's the difference 
between us.

1562
01:42:55,752 --> 01:42:57,212
I'm Odin's firstborn...

1563
01:42:57,462 --> 01:42:59,756
the rightful heir, 
the savior of Asgard.

1564
01:43:00,048 --> 01:43:01,758
And you're nothing.

1565
01:43:12,019 --> 01:43:14,813
So simple, 
even a blind man could see it.

1566
01:43:18,650 --> 01:43:20,777
Now you remind me of Dad.

1567
01:43:31,163 --> 01:43:32,831
The stupid dog won't die!

1568
01:43:54,937 --> 01:43:57,648
Everything's gonna be 
all right now. I got this.

1569
01:43:58,148 --> 01:44:00,108
You wanted to know who I am?

1570
01:44:01,193 --> 01:44:02,694
What the hell 
are you talking about?

1571
01:44:02,986 --> 01:44:04,279
You'll see!

1572
01:44:53,036 --> 01:44:55,163
You see? 
No one's going anywhere.

1573
01:44:55,455 --> 01:44:56,748
I'll get that sword...

1574
01:44:56,915 --> 01:44:59,543
even if I have to kill every 
single one of them to do it.

1575
01:45:26,361 --> 01:45:27,612
Hey, man.

1576
01:45:28,905 --> 01:45:30,157
I'm Korg. This is Miek.

1577
01:45:30,407 --> 01:45:31,575
We're gonna jump 
on that spaceship

1578
01:45:31,616 --> 01:45:32,868
and get out of here. 
Wanna come?

1579
01:45:42,335 --> 01:45:46,089
Your savior is here.

1580
01:45:53,722 --> 01:45:55,432
Did you miss me?

1581
01:45:55,766 --> 01:45:56,975
Everyone, on that ship now.

1582
01:46:01,521 --> 01:46:03,565
Welcome home. 
I saw you coming.

1583
01:46:03,857 --> 01:46:04,858
Of course you did.

1584
01:46:21,708 --> 01:46:23,794
It's a valiant effort, 
but you never stood a chance.

1585
01:46:24,961 --> 01:46:26,004
You see...

1586
01:46:26,880 --> 01:46:29,549
I'm not a queen or a monster.

1587
01:46:31,676 --> 01:46:33,220
I'm the Goddess of Death.

1588
01:46:34,471 --> 01:46:36,556
What were you the god of, again?

1589
01:46:48,193 --> 01:46:49,903
Even when you had two eyes...

1590
01:46:50,779 --> 01:46:52,489
you'd see only half the picture.

1591
01:46:54,032 --> 01:46:56,868
She's too strong. 
Without my hammer, I can't.

1592
01:46:58,245 --> 01:47:01,623
Are you Thor, 
the God of Hammers?

1593
01:47:04,876 --> 01:47:07,170
That hammer was to help you 
control your power,

1594
01:47:07,254 --> 01:47:08,505
to focus it.

1595
01:47:09,423 --> 01:47:11,007
It was never your source 
of strength.

1596
01:47:11,925 --> 01:47:14,052
It's too late. 
She's already taken Asgard.

1597
01:47:15,303 --> 01:47:17,848
Asgard is not a place. 
Never was.

1598
01:47:19,224 --> 01:47:20,308
This could be Asgard.

1599
01:47:21,685 --> 01:47:23,687
Asgard is where 
our people stand.

1600
01:47:24,688 --> 01:47:29,317
Even now, right now, 
those people need your help.

1601
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:39,161
I'm not as strong as you.

1602
01:47:42,038 --> 01:47:43,039
No...

1603
01:47:44,458 --> 01:47:45,709
you're stronger.

1604
01:47:54,843 --> 01:47:56,094
Tell me, brother.

1605
01:47:56,178 --> 01:47:58,513
What were you the god of again?

1606
01:50:14,190 --> 01:50:16,234
- You're late. 
- You're missing an eye.

1607
01:50:16,568 --> 01:50:17,902
This isn't over.

1608
01:50:25,160 --> 01:50:26,786
I think we should 
disband the Revengers.

1609
01:50:28,455 --> 01:50:29,706
Hit her with a lightning blast.

1610
01:50:29,789 --> 01:50:30,957
I just hit her with 
the biggest lightning blast

1611
01:50:30,081 --> 01:50:32,125
in the history of lightning.

1612
01:50:32,208 --> 01:50:33,209
It did nothing.

1613
01:50:37,005 --> 01:50:39,507
We just need to hold her off 
until everyone's on board.

1614
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:41,676
It won't end there.

1615
01:50:42,135 --> 01:50:45,388
The longer Hela's on Asgard, 
the more powerful she grows.

1616
01:50:45,722 --> 01:50:47,307
She'll hunt us down.

1617
01:50:47,515 --> 01:50:48,933
We need to stop her 
here and now.

1618
01:50:49,225 --> 01:50:50,268
So what do we do?

1619
01:50:51,269 --> 01:50:52,604
I'm not doing "Get Help."

1620
01:51:04,991 --> 01:51:08,119
Asgard's not a place, 
it's a people.

1621
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:11,164
Loki...

1622
01:51:11,498 --> 01:51:13,333
this was never about 
stopping Ragnarok.

1623
01:51:13,666 --> 01:51:15,543
This was about causing Ragnarok.

1624
01:51:15,752 --> 01:51:17,253
Surtur's crown, the vault.

1625
01:51:19,130 --> 01:51:20,340
It's the only way.

1626
01:51:21,049 --> 01:51:22,384
Bold move, brother.

1627
01:51:23,802 --> 01:51:25,136
Even for me.

1628
01:51:28,431 --> 01:51:29,432
Shall we?

1629
01:51:30,600 --> 01:51:31,601
After you.

1630
01:51:57,293 --> 01:51:58,628
This is madness.

1631
01:52:12,183 --> 01:52:13,685
Go! Go, now!

1632
01:53:14,954 --> 01:53:16,247
For Asgard.

1633
01:53:30,678 --> 01:53:31,888
Hela!

1634
01:53:56,621 --> 01:54:00,625
With the Eternal Flame, 
you are reborn.

1635
01:54:11,886 --> 01:54:13,388
Hela, enough!

1636
01:54:17,225 --> 01:54:19,852
You want Asgard, it's yours.

1637
01:54:20,353 --> 01:54:23,565
Whatever game you're playing, 
it won't work.

1638
01:54:23,815 --> 01:54:25,233
You can't defeat me.

1639
01:54:26,109 --> 01:54:27,360
No, I know.

1640
01:54:29,070 --> 01:54:30,071
But he can.

1641
01:54:34,576 --> 01:54:35,660
No.

1642
01:54:43,751 --> 01:54:47,046
Tremble before me, Asgard!

1643
01:54:47,297 --> 01:54:49,424
I am your reckoning!

1644
01:54:58,933 --> 01:55:00,351
The people are safe.

1645
01:55:01,102 --> 01:55:02,770
That's all that matters.

1646
01:55:04,689 --> 01:55:05,898
We're fulfilling the prophecy.

1647
01:55:06,649 --> 01:55:07,901
I hate this prophecy.

1648
01:55:08,192 --> 01:55:09,861
So do I, but we have no choice.

1649
01:55:10,153 --> 01:55:11,821
Surtur destroys Asgard...

1650
01:55:12,113 --> 01:55:14,324
he destroys Hela, 
so that our people may live.

1651
01:55:14,449 --> 01:55:16,034
But we need to let him 
finish the job,

1652
01:55:16,117 --> 01:55:17,201
otherwise...

1653
01:55:18,953 --> 01:55:19,954
No!

1654
01:55:22,457 --> 01:55:24,292
Hulk, stop, you moron!

1655
01:55:33,509 --> 01:55:34,552
Hulk, stop.

1656
01:55:34,802 --> 01:55:37,639
Just for once in your life, 
don't smash.

1657
01:55:39,015 --> 01:55:40,600
Big monster!

1658
01:55:41,059 --> 01:55:42,143
Let's go!

1659
01:55:44,020 --> 01:55:45,021
Fine.

1660
01:56:09,212 --> 01:56:11,881
I am Asgard's doom!

1661
01:56:53,381 --> 01:56:55,174
What have I done?

1662
01:56:56,467 --> 01:56:58,761
You saved us from extinction.

1663
01:56:59,053 --> 01:57:00,638
Asgard is not a place...

1664
01:57:02,432 --> 01:57:03,975
it's a people.

1665
01:57:33,296 --> 01:57:34,714
It suits you.

1666
01:57:37,592 --> 01:57:39,927
Maybe you're not so bad 
after all, brother.

1667
01:57:40,386 --> 01:57:41,429
Maybe not.

1668
01:57:42,889 --> 01:57:43,931
Thank you.

1669
01:57:44,849 --> 01:57:47,018
If you were here, 
I might even give you a hug.

1670
01:57:51,522 --> 01:57:52,690
I'm here.

1671
01:58:16,923 --> 01:58:18,174
Your throne.

1672
01:58:33,481 --> 01:58:36,400
So. King of Asgard.

1673
01:58:47,078 --> 01:58:48,079
Where to?

1674
01:58:49,330 --> 01:58:50,581
I'm not sure.

1675
01:58:51,332 --> 01:58:52,416
Any suggestions?

1676
01:58:55,294 --> 01:58:57,004
Miek, where are you from?

1677
01:58:57,380 --> 01:58:59,173
Miek's dead.

1678
01:58:59,465 --> 01:59:02,468
Yeah, no, I accidentally 
stomped on him on the bridge.

1679
01:59:02,635 --> 01:59:03,970
I've just felt so guilty,

1680
01:59:04,053 --> 01:59:05,513
I've been carrying him around 
all day.

1681
01:59:07,390 --> 01:59:09,308
Miek, you're alive!

1682
01:59:09,392 --> 01:59:10,560
He's alive, guys.

1683
01:59:10,643 --> 01:59:11,978
What was 
your question again, bro?

1684
01:59:13,646 --> 01:59:14,647
Earth it is.

1685
02:01:31,409 --> 02:01:32,827
Do you really think 
it's a good idea

1686
02:01:32,910 --> 02:01:33,995
to go back to Earth?

1687
02:01:34,578 --> 02:01:35,579
Yes, of course.

1688
02:01:35,663 --> 02:01:37,748
The people of Earth love me. 
I'm very popular.

1689
02:01:38,290 --> 02:01:40,084
Let me rephrase that.

1690
02:01:40,459 --> 02:01:42,253
Do you really think 
it's a good idea

1691
02:01:42,336 --> 02:01:43,713
to bring me back to Earth?

1692
02:01:44,380 --> 02:01:46,340
Probably not, to be honest.

1693
02:01:46,424 --> 02:01:48,134
I wouldn't worry, brother.

1694
02:01:48,217 --> 02:01:51,220
I feel like everything's 
gonna work out fine.

1695
02:08:20,317 --> 02:08:21,318
Boy.

1696
02:08:29,701 --> 02:08:33,705
I just gotta say, 
I'm proud of you all.

1697
02:08:34,123 --> 02:08:37,334
This revolution has been 
a huge success. Yay, us!

1698
02:08:37,709 --> 02:08:40,087
Pat on the back. 
Pat on the back.

1699
02:08:40,170 --> 02:08:42,423
Come on. No?

1700
02:08:42,965 --> 02:08:44,967
Me too. 'Cause I've been 
a big part of it.

1701
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:47,845
Can't have a revolution 
without somebody to overthrow.

1702
02:08:47,928 --> 02:08:49,805
So, you're welcome.

1703
02:08:50,097 --> 02:08:52,349
And, it's a tie.
