# Silent Hill - Nay Tomorrow Edition

## Synopsis
My wife and I love this movie, but it's quite unwatchable in its current format. 
We wanted a cut that we could watch without having to turn away or fast-forward through sequences. 
We also felt, as did many SH fans, that we don't need a scene explaining all the clues in the movie to us. 
It's a better movie if it leaves the viewer to figure out what happened on their ownâ€”just like the games did.

## Other Sources
Songs from Silent Hill 1 PC OST were used for some sequences adding or replacing the original soundtrack audio.
A SH1 2002 remix called 'Nay Tomorrow' by Tamimi was used towards the end of the movie

## Editing Details
I use KDENLive for all edits. The edit files are available if you'd like to open one of my edits, 
make changes, or re-render in higher def. I tend to cut between scenes on the switching frame,
which allows scenes to be stitched together easier by leaving more room on the wings

## Cuts & Additions
This version cuts nearly all gross/gory/sexist sequences from the movie. Much of the narration 
dialog by Jodelle Ferland was removed along with her poorly acted Alessa sequences. 
Cybil's death sequence is slightly shortened. Christabella's death is removed 
(I'd rather not ever see some of these scenes again, ever).

## Special Thanks:
Tamimi for an awesome remix in the old days that made pay attention to SH.
