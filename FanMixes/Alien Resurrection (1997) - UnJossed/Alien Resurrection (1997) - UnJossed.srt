but fuck you!

864
01:20:26,333 --> 01:20:30,100
Oh, fine. Then I kill her, 
and you kill me,

865
01:20:30,166 --> 01:20:33,166
and we all die, 
and nobody goes home!

866
01:20:33,266 --> 01:20:36,100
Now drop the weapon.

867
01:20:40,333 --> 01:20:42,500
Then this little

868

is gonna plug into the Auriga,

01:20:45,000 --> 01:20:47,300
and she is gonna take us 
right back to home base,

- No, she's not. 
- [ Distephano ] 
Are you crazy?

872
01:20:53,266 --> 01:20:55,300
You still want to bring 
those things back to Earth?

873
01:20:55,400 --> 01:20:59,066
- Haven't you been paying 
any attention today? 
- Ah, the intellectual speaks.

I told you. 
At first, everything was normal.

01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:08,333
The queen laid her eggs. 
But then she started to change.

She added a second cycle cell.

886
01:22:14,366 --> 01:22:16,366
So,

01:22:20,533 --> 01:22:23,900
this time there is no host.

888
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:26,500
There are no eggs.

889
01:22:26,566 --> 01:22:30,300
There is only her womb...

01:22:30,366 --> 01:22:33,166
and the creature inside.

891
01:22:33,233 --> 01:22:36,133
That is Ripley's gift to her:

01:22:36,200 --> 01:22:39,966
a human reproductive system.

893
01:22:40,033 --> 01:22:43,333

for you, Ripley,

I'll open the Auriga's air locks, 
pull the holding clamps on your mark.

Nope.
