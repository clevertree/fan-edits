1
00:01:13,573 --> 00:01:14,949
<i>Don't know how many times.</i>

2
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:18,244
<i>I've been crossed off the 
list and left for dead.</i>

3
00:01:19,204 --> 00:01:22,332
<i>Guess when it first happens 
the day you were born,</i>

4
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,043
<i>you're gonna lose count.</i>

5
00:01:29,964 --> 00:01:31,341
<i>So this,</i>

6
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>this ain't nothing new.</i>

7
00:10:54,487 --> 00:10:56,447
<i>There are bad days,</i>

8
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:01,202
<i>and then there are 
legendary bad days.</i>

9
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:06,040
<i>Whole damn planet 
wanted a piece of me.</i>

10
00:11:10,378 --> 00:11:12,463
<i>Can't stay in the open.</i>

11
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,092
<i>Can't risk another attack.</i>

12
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,199
<i>It's always the punch you don't 
see coming that puts you down.</i>

13
00:11:43,619 --> 00:11:45,496
<i>But why didn't I see it?</i>

14
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:48,040
<i>But why didn't I see it?</i>

15
00:11:51,710 --> 00:11:54,213
<i>Of course they were 
gonna try to kill me.</i>

16
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:56,882
<i>Death is what they 
do for a living.</i>

17
00:12:02,304 --> 00:12:04,640
<i>So the question ain't 
"What happened?".</i>

18
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,976
<i>The question is.</i>

19
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,063
<i>"What happened to me?"</i>

20
00:12:29,373 --> 00:12:31,375
You are the Lord Marshal now.

21
00:12:32,793 --> 00:12:35,004
<i>How did they get so close?</i>

22
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:41,802
<i>How did I let them 
blindside me like that?</i>

23
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,181
Threshold! 
Take us to the threshold!

24
00:12:46,182 --> 00:12:48,017
<i>Necromongers.</i>

25
00:12:48,851 --> 00:12:51,479
<i>Some wanted to put a 
crown on my head.</i>

26
00:12:53,647 --> 00:12:56,525
<i>Some wanted to put a 
noose around my neck.</i>

27
00:12:59,487 --> 00:13:01,989
<i>Okay, more nooses than crowns.</i>

28
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:07,203
<i>I needed a way out.</i>

29
00:13:09,246 --> 00:13:11,207
<i>Some new place.</i>

30
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:16,212
<i>Or maybe just an old one.</i>

31
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,470
<i>But how do you find something 
you've never seen?</i>

32
00:13:37,775 --> 00:13:39,735
Making more friends, I see.

33
00:13:40,778 --> 00:13:42,238
But who put her up to it?

34
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,907
Which commander?

35
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,035
It could be any of many.

36
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:51,664
Don't doubt it for a second,

37
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:54,583
Commander Vaako.

38
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:57,753
Lord Marshal.

39
00:14:06,887 --> 00:14:08,764
They say you lost 
your nerve, Vaako,

40
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,768
after that big 
swing and a miss.

41
00:14:14,937 --> 00:14:16,939
Is that what they say?

42
00:14:20,568 --> 00:14:23,153
Now what are you gonna do 
to get that cred back?

43
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,532
What's the big play?

44
00:14:28,617 --> 00:14:30,244
Something splashy.

45
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,041
Actually,

46
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:39,837
I had in mind 
something different.

47
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:50,890
I've been thinking about 
an early campaign.

48
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:54,977
My very first. 
I was but a boy.

49
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:59,481
We dropped from the sky and 
did what Necromongers do.

50
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:05,321
Destruction was breathtaking.

51
00:15:07,823 --> 00:15:09,700
But then we met resistance.

52
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:13,787
Ferocious like a 
storm of lions.

53
00:15:16,665 --> 00:15:19,668
Each one of them killed 
over a hundred Necro

54
00:15:20,502 --> 00:15:22,379
before their weapons failed.

55
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:27,426
And then they killed 
another 30 more.

56
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:29,595
Barehanded.

57
00:15:32,097 --> 00:15:35,059
Our firepower and 
strength in numbers

58
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:36,977
eventually won us the day.

59
00:15:38,354 --> 00:15:42,316
I can still see him, the last 
of those magnificent warriors,

60
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:44,735
standing on a pile of his own.

61
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:48,948
And he looked at me.

62
00:15:52,451 --> 00:15:55,537
And I will never 
forget those eyes.

63
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:06,173
His eyes were just like yours.

64
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:13,764
The planet was Furya.

65
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,809
I know what it's called.

66
00:16:17,518 --> 00:16:19,645
You just don't 
know where it is.

67
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:22,606
I need charts. I need maps.

68
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,441
- Impossible. 
- I need a direction.

69
00:16:24,525 --> 00:16:26,694
Purged from all records, 
as you well know.

70
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:28,445
But you remember where.

71
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:33,617
So many worlds...

72
00:16:35,661 --> 00:16:38,247
The only map left in existence

73
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:42,960
is the one that's in 
my head, Riddick.

74
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,801
So what do you want?

75
00:16:52,177 --> 00:16:53,679
The crown?

76
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:00,477
Transcendence.

77
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,691
Krone.

78
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:08,610
Break off a ship.

79
00:17:10,112 --> 00:17:11,989
Riddick's going home.

80
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:15,826
<i>Transcendence.</i>

81
00:17:16,952 --> 00:17:22,249
<i>I guess that was Necro speak for "Get the 
fuck off our ship and make it forever."</i>

82
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,668
<i>Fine by me.</i>

83
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,259
<i>You can't blame him 
for dangling Furya.</i>

84
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,596
<i>Home has a certain equity.</i>

85
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:42,603
<i>But I do blame him 
for what came next.</i>

86
00:17:57,493 --> 00:17:59,620
It's along way to come.

87
00:18:00,454 --> 00:18:01,830
For this.

88
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:06,627
<i>This guy with the 
fucked-up face, Krone,</i>

89
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:10,047
<i>he was supposed to 
be our ride home.</i>

90
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:17,096
<i>But instead of Furya, we 
wind up someplace called...</i>

91
00:18:18,222 --> 00:18:19,932
<i>Not Furya.</i>

92
00:18:28,982 --> 00:18:32,194
<i>Yet again, someone was 
trying to play me.</i>

93
00:18:34,655 --> 00:18:36,156
<i>So yet again,</i>

94
00:18:38,617 --> 00:18:40,452
<i>we play for blood.</i>

95
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,297
You keep what you 
kill, Riddick!

96
00:20:16,173 --> 00:20:18,300
You keep what you kill!

97
00:20:24,014 --> 00:20:27,017
<i>Somewhere along 
the way, I lost a step.</i>

98
00:20:27,643 --> 00:20:29,478
<i>I got sloppy.</i>

99
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:31,939
<i>Dulled my own edge.</i>

100
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:37,027
<i>Maybe I went and did the 
worst crime of all...</i>

101
00:20:38,612 --> 00:20:40,739
<i>I got civilized.</i>

102
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,374
<i>So now we zero the clock.</i>

103
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:55,629
<i>Just me and this 
no-name world.</i>

104
00:20:58,423 --> 00:21:01,051
<i>Gotta find that 
animal side again.</i>

105
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:42,319
<i>Before long, I realized there was 
a whole other world over there,</i>

106
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:46,490
<i>of water, grass and life.</i>

107
00:22:48,658 --> 00:22:51,536
<i>Just had one thing in my way.</i>

108
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,986
Hey.

109
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,987
Come on, show me some teeth.

110
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,354
Escape artist, huh?

111
00:30:52,517 --> 00:30:54,727
What you got over there?

112
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,241
Thought we shared everything.

113
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,141
Drop it.

114
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:32,992
Stay.

115
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:10,154
Bounty hunters.

116
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,879
Wait.

117
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,966
Wait...

118
00:33:30,717 --> 00:33:32,051
Steady...

119
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:34,470
Okay, now.

120
00:33:40,309 --> 00:33:41,561
Sounds good.

121
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:45,857
Mmm...

122
00:33:50,987 --> 00:33:51,988
Mmm!

123
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,658
All yours.

124
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:03,958
It says "dog food" on it.

125
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:06,544
If you could read.

126
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,217
Come on.

127
00:34:19,515 --> 00:34:21,768
All right. Bring 
me my reserve.

128
00:34:35,698 --> 00:34:37,158
Where's yours?

129
00:35:06,813 --> 00:35:08,648
Rain.

130
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:10,441
It's a good thing.

131
00:35:11,484 --> 00:35:15,404
Just because you've never seen it 
before doesn't mean it's a bad thing.

132
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,573
Hey, easy.

133
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:34,841
Looks like our 
time is up here.

134
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,127
Nothing.

135
00:37:37,421 --> 00:37:39,298
Look again, Diaz.

136
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:45,972
Somebody should teach this 
Riddick asshole how to count.

137
00:37:46,222 --> 00:37:50,601
"Leave one ship"? Like we've got 
a fucking spare laying around.

138
00:37:51,143 --> 00:37:52,770
Let's crank it up.

139
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,783
Good morning, Cyclops.

140
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:43,529
Shit. Here comes 
the neighborhood.

141
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,161
Small world.

142
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:02,339
Unidentified vessel, this is 
Clan Vagos out of Ursa Five.

143
00:39:02,506 --> 00:39:04,633
Be advised that we are 
on the ground now

144
00:39:04,717 --> 00:39:07,094
and have responded to 
an emergency signal.

145
00:39:07,219 --> 00:39:10,723
No distress found, 
no need to land.

146
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:16,062
I repeat, there is no reason for you 
to land at this location at this time.

147
00:39:16,437 --> 00:39:17,688
<i>Is that clear?</i>

148
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:21,859
<i>No reason for you to land at 
this location at this time.</i>

149
00:39:24,403 --> 00:39:26,614
What the fuck did I just say?

150
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:46,217
It was a long haul. We 
could take on some water.

151
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:50,179
Wouldn't mind a little 
true-gravity time either.

152
00:39:50,596 --> 00:39:53,933
Like I was saying, 
I've got this.

153
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,943
You knew who that was, right? 
On the emergency beacon?

154
00:40:06,362 --> 00:40:07,988
Wouldn't be here if I didn't.

155
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:12,493
The concept of back-up still 
has no appeal to you?

156
00:40:12,868 --> 00:40:15,454
My besties here can 
ball with anyone.

157
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:17,790
No disrespect for 
your crew, of course,

158
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:21,836
who look strong, too, in 
those matchy-matchy outfits.

159
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:25,297
Shit. Didn't know there 
was a dress code.

160
00:40:25,840 --> 00:40:26,924
Yeah, right?

161
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:30,302
Well, it's not my intention 
to jump another man's claim.

162
00:40:30,845 --> 00:40:32,471
If you don't mind, maybe 
we'll just pull up a chair

163
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:34,265
and spectate for a while.

164
00:40:35,850 --> 00:40:37,309
What if I do?

165
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:41,105
Well, this is a co-op station, 
pal. It's open to all Mercs.

166
00:40:42,606 --> 00:40:45,192
- By the way, my name is... 
- "Too late."

167
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,362
That's your name. "Too Late."

168
00:40:49,196 --> 00:40:51,907
And I don't need you stepping all 
over my dick here, my friend.

169
00:40:52,992 --> 00:40:54,869
Well, I'll tell you what.

170
00:40:55,703 --> 00:40:59,957
I won't lift a finger to help until 
you come ask me for it. How's that?

171
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:18,934
I was scoping 
this out earlier.

172
00:41:19,018 --> 00:41:21,020
It's a cave system. 
Five clicks South.

173
00:41:21,687 --> 00:41:22,897
Might be worth a look.

174
00:41:24,190 --> 00:41:25,816
Hey, Too Late.

175
00:41:26,317 --> 00:41:28,027
Need to pull a node 
from your ship

176
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,862
and store it right here 
next to mine. Okay?

177
00:41:29,904 --> 00:41:31,405
Really? Why is that?

178
00:41:31,489 --> 00:41:34,992
Riddick triggered the beacon 
to get off-world, right?

179
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:39,622
Basically, he was 
calling a taxi.

180
00:41:41,332 --> 00:41:42,666
And...

181
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,711
And a ship would make 
a sweet trap, right?

182
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:50,090
Confined space, metal 
walls, jail cell.

183
00:41:51,383 --> 00:41:52,593
Is cool, huh?

184
00:41:52,843 --> 00:41:54,553
Is it true half the 
people you meet

185
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,305
are below average 
intelligence?

186
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:59,141
Got to make sure the ship stays 
grounded when he comes for them, okay?

187
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,935
Come on.

188
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:04,230
Dahl, pull a node 
from the ship.

189
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,005
I'll do it...

190
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,131
Ooh!

191
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,174
Ooh...

192
00:42:51,652 --> 00:42:53,612
Any time now, Riddick.

193
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:19,305
I'm telling you, this 
is total overkill.

194
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:21,307
What? Eleven of 
us out here now?

195
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:24,310
Should have been a 
four-man op, tops.

196
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,438
You are jinxing our janx, man. 
And that ain't cool.

197
00:43:27,479 --> 00:43:30,858
Hey, I don't give a shit 
what they say. He's one guy.

198
00:43:33,235 --> 00:43:34,987
Whatever you say, man.

199
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,489
He's one guy.

200
00:43:40,784 --> 00:43:41,994
Man...

201
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:55,716
So I guess that's what passes for 
a fucking moon on this planet.

202
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:59,094
It's gonna be a dark night.

203
00:43:59,636 --> 00:44:01,221
Advantage, him.

204
00:44:02,473 --> 00:44:06,560
Maybe he's gonna wear you down first. 
Force you to go without sleep.

205
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,479
Can't you see I'm busy?

206
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,565
I'm just sharing my thoughts.

207
00:44:11,607 --> 00:44:14,318
Well, now that you have,

208
00:44:15,986 --> 00:44:18,238
can I politely invite you to

209
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:20,783
step off my fucking porch?

210
00:44:23,452 --> 00:44:25,412
I'll start rotating down.

211
00:44:25,454 --> 00:44:26,914
You let me know, huh?

212
00:44:26,955 --> 00:44:30,626
As soon as I have his head in 
a box, I will let you know.

213
00:44:55,192 --> 00:44:57,403
Grid 29D. Stand by, stand by.

214
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:04,118
<i>What you got, cuz?</i>

215
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:09,456
Aha, some dingo-dongo thing.

216
00:45:13,043 --> 00:45:15,546
Yeah. I see it now.

217
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:17,131
<i>You want me to pop it?</i>

218
00:45:17,172 --> 00:45:19,758
Knock it down. One 
shot suppressed.

219
00:45:24,805 --> 00:45:27,433
Nice work, Diaz. Encouraging.

220
00:45:28,308 --> 00:45:30,018
Had something in my eye.

221
00:45:30,436 --> 00:45:32,062
<i>It's called a scope.</i>

222
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,814
<i>Try next time.</i>

223
00:45:34,022 --> 00:45:35,607
<i>You got this, right?</i>

224
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:39,445
Will you get off my 
freaking frequency!

225
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:04,720
What the fuck is 
going on here?

226
00:46:27,117 --> 00:46:28,869
<i>Thank fucking God!</i>

227
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:30,954
Fuck off!

228
00:46:33,707 --> 00:46:37,586
Rubio, coming your way now. 
Gotta swap out a bad sensor.

229
00:46:41,632 --> 00:46:44,134
What was here versus 
what was found.

230
00:46:44,468 --> 00:46:46,178
How does it square?

231
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,096
Pretty good. I mean, 
the morphine's gone,

232
00:46:48,138 --> 00:46:50,849
but that's always the 
first thing to go.

233
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:53,727
That was a bit weird, though.

234
00:46:54,561 --> 00:46:57,773
"A predator restraint with 
42-inch offset jaws."

235
00:46:58,148 --> 00:47:00,317
Six listed, zero found.

236
00:47:01,068 --> 00:47:03,445
That is an odd thing 
to go for a walk.

237
00:47:03,779 --> 00:47:06,532
Yeah, but, Boss, you know how shit 
goes missing from these stations.

238
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:09,868
One bad year and guys are 
ripping shit off for salvage.

239
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,670
Hey, Santana?

240
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:22,923
You did sweep the area 
before I got here, right?

241
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:25,008
Sweep for what?

242
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:27,511
<i>I just want to make sure 
no one has set any traps for us.</i>

243
00:47:27,553 --> 00:47:28,804
5Q.

244
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:33,392
Understand what I'm saying?

245
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:35,769
Traps? What kind of traps?

246
00:47:36,186 --> 00:47:37,813
<i>The kind with jaws.</i>

247
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:46,613
Don't touch that 
fucking thing!

248
00:47:53,036 --> 00:47:54,037
What?

249
00:47:58,250 --> 00:47:59,334
Up-armor.

250
00:48:10,178 --> 00:48:11,263
Shit!

251
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:13,056
Ready. Ready.

252
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,104
Stay put, 
stay put, stay put, stay put!

253
00:48:22,649 --> 00:48:23,901
Oopah!

254
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,366
<i>Who the hell was 
that screaming and why?</i>

255
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:36,455
Nunez, break out 
the sweep gear.

256
00:48:37,414 --> 00:48:40,876
And figure out how many 
of these big-ass traps

257
00:48:40,917 --> 00:48:42,919
we got out here, okay?

258
00:48:43,962 --> 00:48:46,340
I'm thinking maybe the 
whole upper left quad

259
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:48,842
is some kind of 
fucking mine field.

260
00:48:49,343 --> 00:48:51,595
You got to do that 
now, okay, Nunez?

261
00:48:53,597 --> 00:48:55,223
<i>Copy that, Nunez?</i>

262
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,480
Nunez?

263
00:49:03,523 --> 00:49:06,151
This is bad. This is very bad.

264
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:09,613
Nunez? Nunez?

265
00:49:09,655 --> 00:49:11,156
<i>Shut the fuck up, puto!</i>

266
00:49:11,198 --> 00:49:13,825
His radio just crapped out. 
Someone get eyes on him.

267
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:17,245
<i>Make sure he's right where he 
should be, 13-H. Go, go, go!</i>

268
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:25,629
Right here.

269
00:49:25,712 --> 00:49:27,839
13-H. He's supposed to 
be right fucking...

270
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:40,435
Don't mess with me now.

271
00:49:42,521 --> 00:49:43,647
Hey. Hey, what is it? 
What is it?

272
00:49:43,689 --> 00:49:44,940
- Get back! 
- It's me, it's me.

273
00:49:44,982 --> 00:49:46,441
He's got Falco!

274
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:57,494
Jock up, but you're 
staying home.

275
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,956
No one's going out 
there until I say so.

276
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:02,666
<i>Man down, 
he's got Falco.</i>

277
00:50:02,666 --> 00:50:03,917
<i>Compromise, compromise.</i>

278
00:50:03,959 --> 00:50:04,960
<i>How the fuck 
did he do that?</i>

279
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,004
<i>Never ever saw him, man. 
He was right here and I never...</i>

280
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:08,130
<i>What about the ship? 
Is he on it?</i>

281
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:10,173
<i>He's not coming for the 
ships, he's coming for fucking us!</i>

282
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,883
<i>Just fucking shoot! Shoot!</i>

283
00:50:20,183 --> 00:50:21,935
One night, three dead.

284
00:50:22,686 --> 00:50:24,438
Not sure I'm 
loving this trend.

285
00:50:25,105 --> 00:50:26,314
Two dead, one missing.

286
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:27,858
Exactly. Three dead.

287
00:50:27,899 --> 00:50:30,527
Well, look at it 
this way, boys.

288
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,781
We might all fit 
on one ship now.

289
00:50:34,865 --> 00:50:35,991
Diaz!

290
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,497
Get those other 
traps back there.

291
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:47,335
Luna, say something 
Bible-like over these bodies.

292
00:50:57,512 --> 00:50:59,264
Okay, maybe,

293
00:51:00,932 --> 00:51:02,809
we zero this out.

294
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,438
What is your tag anyway?

295
00:51:06,938 --> 00:51:08,899
So now you wanna know my name.

296
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,403
Well, I'm not sure 
I'm gonna say.

297
00:51:13,570 --> 00:51:16,573
Because everyone you know by 
name, Santana, winds up dead.

298
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:21,286
You gonna clean this shit up?

299
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:32,547
- Excuse me. 
- Wow.

300
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:35,133
Watch out for 
surprise attacks.

301
00:51:35,967 --> 00:51:37,093
Maybe...

302
00:51:37,803 --> 00:51:41,765
Maybe it's time to start 
merging assets, right?

303
00:51:44,351 --> 00:51:46,311
So this is you 
asking for my help?

304
00:51:46,686 --> 00:51:50,065
This is me saying that I may 
need some of your gear.

305
00:51:51,817 --> 00:51:55,612
If some of your guys happen to 
come attached to that gear,

306
00:51:56,279 --> 00:52:00,325
I will understand that's 
the way it's gotta be.

307
00:52:01,785 --> 00:52:03,662
So you're asking for 
my gear's help?

308
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:05,914
More like that.

309
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:08,208
Moss...

310
00:52:15,298 --> 00:52:17,801
The gear's saying, 
"Nah." Bitch.

311
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:20,136
There's your answer.

312
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,347
What the fuck do 
you want, man?

313
00:52:22,472 --> 00:52:25,809
You know what? I'm gonna 
fold you in, Santana.

314
00:52:26,142 --> 00:52:30,147
But I give orders to Dahl. And 
Delhi's gonna give orders to you.

315
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,275
And that's the chain of command 
from this point forward.

316
00:52:33,817 --> 00:52:36,528
Why am I not loving 
this plan so far?

317
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:40,323
Oh, I know, I know. 
You know why?

318
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:42,993
Because it sucks 
ass and swallows!

319
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:46,079
I'm not taking orders 
from your pet whore

320
00:52:46,121 --> 00:52:47,789
who thinks I won't smack 
her right back...

321
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,960
I don't fuck guys.

322
00:52:53,003 --> 00:52:55,505
Occasionally I fuck 'em 
up if they need it.

323
00:52:58,174 --> 00:53:01,428
Here's what's gonna happen, Santana. 
You're gonna take a back seat.

324
00:53:01,678 --> 00:53:03,555
We'll track Riddick 
down, I promise.

325
00:53:04,055 --> 00:53:05,682
But I want him alive.

326
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:09,895
You give me a day, and after 
that he's yours to kill.

327
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,272
You're giving me the bounty?

328
00:53:12,355 --> 00:53:16,443
You pay my crew, fuel costs, the 
rest is yours. That's the deal.

329
00:53:18,028 --> 00:53:22,157
What is Riddick for you? 
Not just some convict.

330
00:53:22,532 --> 00:53:25,160
What do you want? 
Why are you here?

331
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:26,745
Who are you?

332
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:29,372
My name is Johns.

333
00:53:29,748 --> 00:53:32,125
Lock down those ships, 
get those hogs on deck.

334
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:34,127
I will ride with 
Moss and Lockspur.

335
00:53:34,169 --> 00:53:38,423
I want a non-lethal load-out, L.O.D.'s 
and phosphor frags to start with.

336
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:42,427
This is a man that hunts by night. 
We'll take it to him by day.

337
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,098
Diaz! Vargas! Show me the 
spot of the last kill.

338
00:53:50,393 --> 00:53:51,895
Some kind of canine.

339
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:07,410
Hey, Diaz, I got a dog here.

340
00:54:07,869 --> 00:54:10,872
Is it the same dingo-dongo 
thing from last night?

341
00:54:11,247 --> 00:54:12,832
Nah, I'm pretty sure 
we killed that one.

342
00:54:20,423 --> 00:54:21,925
Could be the same one.

343
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,593
The same.

344
00:54:23,635 --> 00:54:26,388
Dahl, get your sniper rifle 
and barium rounds now.

345
00:54:38,149 --> 00:54:39,651
1,500 meters.

346
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,559
Could be just the first hole it found.

347
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:58,313
A stressed animal is gonna 
run to ground it knows.

348
00:55:59,773 --> 00:56:02,650
Besides, I'm getting 
human pheromones.

349
00:57:25,984 --> 00:57:27,360
Riddick!

350
00:57:34,617 --> 00:57:36,703
Dial down, dial 
down, dial down!

351
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:45,879
Santana's guy.

352
00:57:45,962 --> 00:57:47,046
Falco.

353
00:57:47,088 --> 00:57:49,090
Shit. Did we 
just kill a hostage?

354
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:51,009
I've been hunting 
Riddick for 10 years.

355
00:57:51,134 --> 00:57:54,012
The concept of a hostage 
has no appeal to him.

356
00:57:54,053 --> 00:57:55,930
Falco was already dead.

357
00:57:56,431 --> 00:57:59,559
This is just some fucking 
sideshow to buy more time.

358
00:58:02,187 --> 00:58:04,272
Whoa! Fuck...

359
00:58:05,315 --> 00:58:06,691
Shit.

360
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:11,946
Just dropped some 
mud right there.

361
00:58:13,072 --> 00:58:15,200
So if Riddick isn't here...

362
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:25,585
Remember, he could 
be anywhere.

363
00:59:16,261 --> 00:59:18,638
<i>This is Johns to 
any-goddamn-body at the station.</i>

364
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:23,393
<i>I want you to keep an eye on that 
locker. Keep an eye on the node.</i>

365
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:26,187
<i>Riddick may have 
made an end run.</i>

366
00:59:26,771 --> 00:59:30,650
<i>My ETA is seven minutes. 
But watch your back.</i>

367
01:00:11,858 --> 01:00:13,693
You need to see this.

368
01:00:22,327 --> 01:00:23,453
He wrote that?

369
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:27,915
He took out our deep space 
communications. All of it.

370
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:32,045
And whose blood is that? 
There... Here...

371
01:00:32,712 --> 01:00:34,339
Over there...

372
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:42,388
I had to kick his ass again. 
Sorry.

373
01:00:43,765 --> 01:00:44,891
Not really.

374
01:00:52,940 --> 01:00:54,067
Fuck it.

375
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,695
Let's take a look at this.

376
01:01:09,707 --> 01:01:10,917
Six.

377
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:12,669
Huh.

378
01:01:15,505 --> 01:01:16,714
Six.

379
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:22,345
You are a shit storm trooper, 
Santana. I'll give you that.

380
01:01:22,678 --> 01:01:24,806
You beat the devil this time.

381
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:27,266
Didn't actually 
think he was gonna do it.

382
01:01:27,809 --> 01:01:29,560
This is a sign.

383
01:01:30,687 --> 01:01:34,399
Ah, sweet.

384
01:01:34,691 --> 01:01:36,567
I believe this is a sign.

385
01:01:39,237 --> 01:01:42,073
It may be that the good Lord 
wants us to take these nodes

386
01:01:42,323 --> 01:01:45,576
and flee this planet 
just as soon as we can.

387
01:01:49,872 --> 01:01:52,083
That's my good luck charm.

388
01:01:55,420 --> 01:01:57,255
Wrong business, kid.

389
01:01:58,339 --> 01:02:01,926
You know, I was kind of 
hoping the bomb would go off.

390
01:02:10,727 --> 01:02:15,356
So we sealed up his cave with some 
phosphor frags here, so he can't go back.

391
01:02:15,398 --> 01:02:18,401
And just like an animal, he's 
gonna head to known ground.

392
01:02:18,443 --> 01:02:21,446
But we're gonna find he's got 
three or four lairs out there.

393
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:24,407
So we'll radius out 
from this point, here.

394
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:28,828
Now radio comms... I saw three 
repeaters listed in inventory.

395
01:02:28,870 --> 01:02:31,747
Find them. Set them up 
at regular intervals.

396
01:02:32,248 --> 01:02:34,709
I never want to be out of 
touch like that again.

397
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,829
Are you scared of me?

398
01:03:13,915 --> 01:03:15,041
Yeah.

399
01:03:19,086 --> 01:03:21,047
Are they scared of me?

400
01:03:22,673 --> 01:03:24,926
Yes, they're scared of you.

401
01:03:30,807 --> 01:03:33,643
Maybe you're all scared 
of the wrong thing.

402
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,395
Lockspur, I want you to lock 
down those hogs, all right?

403
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:39,690
I don't want this guy any more 
mobile than he already is.

404
01:03:39,732 --> 01:03:42,443
Now, Dahl, I spotted a 
nice little nest for you.

405
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:44,445
Right here and in 
these low hills.

406
01:03:51,118 --> 01:03:52,245
Moss?

407
01:03:55,706 --> 01:03:57,333
I just saw him.

408
01:03:58,834 --> 01:04:00,461
Say again?

409
01:04:01,295 --> 01:04:02,922
I just saw him.

410
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:15,268
Dahl, I want you to 
sit on this ship!

411
01:04:15,309 --> 01:04:17,812
Diaz, make sure your 
ship is locked down!

412
01:04:17,854 --> 01:04:19,856
The rest of you get on 
the fucking perimeter

413
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:21,941
and keep your eyes 
on each other!

414
01:04:21,983 --> 01:04:25,361
Santana! He got the 
fucking nodes!

415
01:05:13,117 --> 01:05:15,620
I know. It's coming.

416
01:05:18,956 --> 01:05:20,583
So then we just combine nodes.

417
01:05:20,625 --> 01:05:22,793
Pull one from that ship, put 
it in this ship, you know?

418
01:05:22,793 --> 01:05:23,919
Amps is amps, right?

419
01:05:23,961 --> 01:05:26,589
It's not about amps. It's about 
What each ship is rated to handle.

420
01:05:26,714 --> 01:05:29,425
You miss by even a few milli-joules, 
you fry every chip you've got.

421
01:05:29,467 --> 01:05:31,802
Okay, so figure out the 
difference, and just do it.

422
01:05:31,928 --> 01:05:33,512
Jailbreak the fucking thing.

423
01:05:33,679 --> 01:05:35,556
I could give you 
a crash course

424
01:05:35,598 --> 01:05:38,851
on thermodynamic equilibrium 
and energy exchange right now,

425
01:05:38,935 --> 01:05:40,937
or maybe you just want to take 
my goddamn word for it...

426
01:05:40,978 --> 01:05:42,313
I get it. I get it.

427
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,441
The ships are incompatible. We're not 
gonna fly without the nodes back.

428
01:05:45,483 --> 01:05:47,568
Why do I feel like we just 
cut off our own nuts here?

429
01:05:47,610 --> 01:05:48,944
Probably because we did.

430
01:05:49,278 --> 01:05:51,781
How about I take one of those jet 
hogs, two days' worth of food

431
01:05:51,822 --> 01:05:53,574
and go out and hunt this 
fucker down myself?

432
01:05:53,616 --> 01:05:56,118
Bad idea, Diaz. 
One-on-one with Riddick?

433
01:05:56,285 --> 01:05:58,663
I might be able to get the 
emergency beacon working again.

434
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:01,332
That's like an ambulance calling 
for an ambulance, isn't it?

435
01:06:01,374 --> 01:06:03,501
It's back-up for the 
fucking back-up. We can't.

436
01:06:03,709 --> 01:06:05,336
I thought he was 
the one stranded here.

437
01:06:05,419 --> 01:06:07,338
Yeah, well, looks 
like you thought wrong.

438
01:06:07,338 --> 01:06:09,674
<i>Long wait for back-up.</i>

439
01:06:11,384 --> 01:06:12,718
In case you were 
thinking about

440
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:15,513
<i>fixing the beacon and 
calling for help.</i>

441
01:06:15,888 --> 01:06:17,515
Falco's radio.

442
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:21,018
Riddick, I don't give a 
fuck about the back-up.

443
01:06:21,852 --> 01:06:23,479
Because I've still got 
all kinds of gear

444
01:06:23,521 --> 01:06:25,022
that can ruin your 
day in a hurry.

445
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:29,986
So you go find another 
fucking cave.

446
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:32,863
You keep running, 
you keep hiding.

447
01:06:33,572 --> 01:06:35,574
Doesn't matter me none.

448
01:06:36,367 --> 01:06:39,120
Because in the end, 
I will find you!

449
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:43,457
Look South.

450
01:07:04,729 --> 01:07:06,564
I don't believe it.

451
01:07:06,981 --> 01:07:09,233
The balls on this fucking guy.

452
01:07:11,610 --> 01:07:13,988
Dahl, keep an eye 
on things here.

453
01:07:16,323 --> 01:07:17,408
What should I do?

454
01:07:17,450 --> 01:07:18,451
Stay low.

455
01:07:21,287 --> 01:07:23,038
Come on. Come on.

456
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:46,395
Both of you drop.

457
01:08:09,335 --> 01:08:11,295
So what's the bounty at?

458
01:08:11,670 --> 01:08:14,423
I don't know. I don't care. 
It's not why I'm here.

459
01:08:14,507 --> 01:08:16,717
I bet the big jamoke knows.

460
01:08:17,009 --> 01:08:19,512
Yeah. I know exactly 
what it is.

461
01:08:20,179 --> 01:08:23,682
What I do know is that it's double 
if you're brought back dead.

462
01:08:24,558 --> 01:08:26,018
That's new.

463
01:08:27,520 --> 01:08:30,272
Will it be enough to 
pay for your funerals?

464
01:08:32,066 --> 01:08:34,026
What I'm interested in

465
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:38,739
is a little backwater place 
with a system code M-344/G.

466
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,535
I want to know what happened 
there 10 years ago.

467
01:08:45,538 --> 01:08:46,914
The father.

468
01:08:50,876 --> 01:08:52,253
Big Daddy Johns.

469
01:08:52,336 --> 01:08:53,712
Yeah, that's right.

470
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:57,675
And you traveled all 
this way just to see me.

471
01:08:59,969 --> 01:09:01,220
I'm flattered.

472
01:09:01,762 --> 01:09:02,847
It's kind of strange 
not knowing

473
01:09:02,888 --> 01:09:04,640
what to put down in 
the family Bible.

474
01:09:05,099 --> 01:09:08,227
It's kind of strange three guys have 
to die just so that you can hear...

475
01:09:08,269 --> 01:09:11,147
No, no, no. You don't get 
to put that shit on me.

476
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:13,399
Those kills are on you.

477
01:09:13,691 --> 01:09:17,194
I have a feeling that's not the 
only thing on me right now.

478
01:09:17,611 --> 01:09:20,531
Okay, got barium shells, 
stab-shock, explosive tip.

479
01:09:20,573 --> 01:09:22,825
What do you want, 
barium or stab-shock?

480
01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,869
Horse tranq.

481
01:09:25,452 --> 01:09:26,537
Okay.

482
01:09:33,294 --> 01:09:36,547
I'll give you till that 
rain hits that station.

483
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,259
That's your clock.

484
01:09:57,443 --> 01:09:59,403
Dahl! Do it now! Now!

485
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:17,046
Again!

486
01:10:23,219 --> 01:10:24,720
He's not going down.

487
01:10:26,639 --> 01:10:28,015
Do it again, Dahl!

488
01:10:33,437 --> 01:10:34,146
Just go down.

489
01:10:56,752 --> 01:10:58,087
I got this, Dahl.

490
01:11:32,621 --> 01:11:33,747
Riddick.

491
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:35,374
Riddick?

492
01:11:44,717 --> 01:11:46,093
Johns?

493
01:11:49,263 --> 01:11:51,765
We beating men in chains now?

494
01:11:58,147 --> 01:12:01,650
Okay, from the beginning. 
For the historical record...

495
01:12:02,735 --> 01:12:03,819
<i>The Hunter Gratzner.</i>

496
01:12:03,861 --> 01:12:05,237
That's the commercial 
vessel my son uses

497
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:06,655
to transport you 
back to the slammer.

498
01:12:06,697 --> 01:12:11,410
But that ship sends a distress 
call somewhere near M-344/G.

499
01:12:11,618 --> 01:12:15,080
It's a backwater system, with 
two suns, one habitable planet.

500
01:12:17,374 --> 01:12:19,501
Does he survive the crash?

501
01:12:20,586 --> 01:12:22,963
Big drama the next few hours.

502
01:12:23,714 --> 01:12:28,093
But whatever happens, no 
matter what they tell you,

503
01:12:29,887 --> 01:12:31,889
don't let 'em take 
these chains off me.

504
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:34,808
Them? Who's "them"? Who 
are you talking...

505
01:12:34,892 --> 01:12:36,894
Do you know who you're 
talking to here?

506
01:12:41,357 --> 01:12:42,608
That was for me?

507
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,113
For the historical record,

508
01:12:49,907 --> 01:12:51,033
he made it.

509
01:12:57,414 --> 01:12:59,166
So it's just you and him?

510
01:13:00,375 --> 01:13:01,585
Was, uh,

511
01:13:02,795 --> 01:13:05,547
about the same number you 
see here in this room.

512
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:09,176
So how many made it off?

513
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:11,095
Three.

514
01:13:12,638 --> 01:13:13,972
But not him?

515
01:13:15,933 --> 01:13:17,142
No.

516
01:13:17,810 --> 01:13:20,145
So between the time of the crash and 
the time you leave that planet,

517
01:13:21,146 --> 01:13:23,565
my son dies.

518
01:13:23,982 --> 01:13:28,487
And I can safely assume it's 
at your hands. Is that right?

519
01:13:31,406 --> 01:13:32,199
Tell me what you see 
outside that window, Dahl.

520
01:13:32,991 --> 01:13:37,621
Tell me what you see 
outside that window, Dahl.

521
01:13:48,757 --> 01:13:50,968
Cyclops unit, two ships,

522
01:13:51,343 --> 01:13:53,595
couple dead guys in plastic.

523
01:13:54,263 --> 01:13:56,014
And you don't see anything else?

524
01:13:56,181 --> 01:13:57,683
Nothing else.

525
01:14:15,701 --> 01:14:17,077
Time's up.

526
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:24,835
Time is up.

527
01:14:26,628 --> 01:14:28,380
He's all yours.

528
01:14:35,304 --> 01:14:36,930
Hold him down.

529
01:15:11,507 --> 01:15:13,091
More dingo-dongos maybe.

530
01:15:17,721 --> 01:15:19,056
Lucky.

531
01:15:22,392 --> 01:15:24,603
I know what's coming.

532
01:15:25,646 --> 01:15:29,149
Called to find you. 
The serpents...

533
01:15:50,212 --> 01:15:51,463
spotlight!

534
01:16:18,574 --> 01:16:19,908
Like I said,

535
01:16:21,326 --> 01:16:23,829
it ain't me you 
gotta worry about.

536
01:16:28,333 --> 01:16:30,544
What is it? What's out there?

537
01:16:31,003 --> 01:16:32,254
I don't know.

538
01:16:33,338 --> 01:16:34,840
Fucked up or 
something out there.

539
01:16:35,465 --> 01:16:38,844
It ain't right. 
It's coming our way.

540
01:16:47,936 --> 01:16:51,189
Whatever they are, they 
ain't so hard to kill.

541
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:33,565
What the fuck?

542
01:17:54,586 --> 01:17:55,796
Fuck!

543
01:18:10,185 --> 01:18:12,187
No more holes, please.

544
01:18:33,959 --> 01:18:37,045
What the fuck is happening? 
How fucked are we?

545
01:18:37,421 --> 01:18:39,923
Who knows how long 
it will rain?

546
01:18:41,425 --> 01:18:45,554
Or just how many of them 
are buried out there?

547
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:51,727
He saw it. He saw it with those eyes 
of his and he didn't tell us what.

548
01:19:01,695 --> 01:19:04,823
One ship for you, one for me.

549
01:19:05,699 --> 01:19:08,785
I need to know that these 
nodes are retrievable.

550
01:19:10,454 --> 01:19:12,956
And I need to know 
we have a deal.

551
01:19:17,335 --> 01:19:18,962
We got a deal.

552
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,555
The chains stay on.

553
01:19:41,777 --> 01:19:43,737
Why don't we sit this one out?

554
01:19:46,698 --> 01:19:47,949
Okay. Okay.

555
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:51,369
Up, up, up...

556
01:19:54,623 --> 01:19:56,082
Good doggie.

557
01:20:20,899 --> 01:20:21,900
Oh!

558
01:20:22,943 --> 01:20:25,153
Holy shit.

559
01:21:17,789 --> 01:21:20,667
Where the hell did that... Jesus Christ!

560
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:23,086
No, no, no!

561
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:28,550
What the fuck is wrong with 
you, you crazy bastard?

562
01:21:28,592 --> 01:21:29,843
You could have killed me!

563
01:21:29,926 --> 01:21:31,678
Got it, didn't I?

564
01:21:39,811 --> 01:21:41,438
Vargas, get up.

565
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:44,357
Vargas, get up. 
Come on, let's go.

566
01:21:44,691 --> 01:21:46,318
Vargas, come on, man. 
Walk it off.

567
01:21:46,401 --> 01:21:48,028
Let's go. It's 
just a little one.

568
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:50,196
Small ones are the worst.

569
01:21:51,823 --> 01:21:53,992
They save the most venom.

570
01:22:14,387 --> 01:22:16,264
I forgot to mention,

571
01:22:17,766 --> 01:22:19,643
there's no weapons for you.

572
01:22:26,399 --> 01:22:28,401
You think you can ride 
one of these things?

573
01:22:28,943 --> 01:22:31,029
I'll ride it like I stole it.

574
01:22:45,585 --> 01:22:47,212
I'll take flank.

575
01:22:58,098 --> 01:23:00,350
If Riddick comes back 
here without us,

576
01:23:00,392 --> 01:23:03,520
you go ahead, you kill him 
on general principle.

577
01:23:03,728 --> 01:23:06,815
Is that before or after 
I'm supposed to fuck him?

578
01:25:41,511 --> 01:25:44,389
How bad you want 
those nodes, Johns?

579
01:26:20,174 --> 01:26:23,511
I don't suppose you took the 
time to do this for him, huh?

580
01:26:25,638 --> 01:26:28,391
This may come as a 
shock to you, Johns,

581
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:31,811
but I didn't ghost your son.

582
01:26:33,897 --> 01:26:36,482
He seemed set on 
killing himself.

583
01:26:39,861 --> 01:26:41,738
What the fuck does that mean?

584
01:26:42,488 --> 01:26:43,948
Morphine.

585
01:26:45,491 --> 01:26:47,118
Your son liked his morphine.

586
01:26:48,411 --> 01:26:50,371
Liked it twice a day.

587
01:26:51,205 --> 01:26:53,708
Didn't know your 
son was a junkie?

588
01:26:57,212 --> 01:26:59,214
Johns was like most Mercs.

589
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:03,259
They look all 
stand-up and do-right

590
01:27:03,927 --> 01:27:06,804
until you out them open and 
you find something missing.

591
01:27:07,764 --> 01:27:09,641
In his case, a spine.

592
01:27:11,517 --> 01:27:14,979
I don't have to listen to this 
shit! That's not the man I knew.

593
01:27:15,104 --> 01:27:17,482
Then you didn't know your son.

594
01:27:22,570 --> 01:27:24,656
He wanted to kill a kid.

595
01:27:26,282 --> 01:27:28,159
To save his own skin.

596
01:27:28,701 --> 01:27:30,828
I had a problem with that.

597
01:27:32,121 --> 01:27:34,123
You expect me to believe

598
01:27:34,624 --> 01:27:37,877
my son was gonna kill a 
child to save his own life?

599
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:43,716
Morphine makes the 
brain soft. Heart weak.

600
01:27:47,470 --> 01:27:49,472
I don't fucking buy it!

601
01:27:49,889 --> 01:27:52,100
I just can't believe that 
my son's the bad guy

602
01:27:52,141 --> 01:27:55,269
in this fucking demented 
fairy tale of yours.

603
01:27:58,106 --> 01:28:00,066
No reason to lie now.

604
01:28:02,944 --> 01:28:04,153
Johns.

605
01:28:07,365 --> 01:28:08,866
Either one of us.

606
01:28:38,146 --> 01:28:40,648
Thanks for starting the killing 
spree for me, Riddick.

607
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,567
But I'll take it from here.

608
01:29:35,203 --> 01:29:36,537
Jamoke.

609
01:29:41,501 --> 01:29:44,462
So that blade you buried 
was meant for me?

610
01:29:45,922 --> 01:29:48,424
Anyone who deserved 
it, really.

611
01:29:51,803 --> 01:29:53,179
We've got a problem, Riddick,

612
01:29:55,098 --> 01:29:57,725
because I've got 
two nodes here.

613
01:29:57,767 --> 01:29:59,644
We've got one hog.

614
01:29:59,769 --> 01:30:03,898
And I sure as shit am not 
riding bitch with you again.

615
01:30:06,150 --> 01:30:07,485
One hog?

616
01:30:08,945 --> 01:30:10,780
You sure about that, Johns?

617
01:30:16,661 --> 01:30:19,247
He pulled the goddamn 
turbine pin!

618
01:30:20,706 --> 01:30:22,792
You just figured that out?

619
01:30:23,334 --> 01:30:26,838
Diaz was gonna take the nodes 
for himself and ghost me.

620
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:30,007
He was gonna leave 
you out here alone.

621
01:30:30,466 --> 01:30:31,968
So what now?

622
01:30:39,350 --> 01:30:41,811
Now we switch to 
our ground game.

623
01:30:43,312 --> 01:30:46,691
Let's see if that lack of 
spine runs in the family.

624
01:31:38,701 --> 01:31:39,952
Reload!

625
01:31:46,250 --> 01:31:47,960
Watch your head.

626
01:31:58,304 --> 01:31:59,430
Go!

627
01:34:02,678 --> 01:34:03,804
I got inbound.

628
01:34:19,111 --> 01:34:20,738
Take this!

629
01:34:21,030 --> 01:34:22,782
Is it just you?

630
01:34:23,657 --> 01:34:25,993
Just slam this thing in. 
See if it's still good.

631
01:34:29,372 --> 01:34:30,373
Boss...

632
01:34:30,456 --> 01:34:34,043
Just see if the fucking thing 
works! We need to get outta here.

633
01:38:38,329 --> 01:38:41,832
Extraction, 30 seconds or less. 
Let's go, let's go!

634
01:39:54,363 --> 01:39:56,365
<i>Lot of good 
men died here, Riddick.</i>

635
01:39:56,615 --> 01:40:00,577
Not sure how I'm supposed to 
overlook that. Next time.

636
01:40:00,911 --> 01:40:02,913
Yeah. Things would 
have been different

637
01:40:03,038 --> 01:40:05,416
if they weren't trying 
to put my head in a box.

638
01:40:08,085 --> 01:40:10,170
So where to now, Riddick?

639
01:40:10,796 --> 01:40:14,758
You know what? Fuck that. 
Don't tell me. I don't wanna know.

640
01:40:15,551 --> 01:40:17,553
<i>I'll tell you this, Johns.</i>

641
01:40:17,928 --> 01:40:21,181
<i>Sooner or later, we all 
have to head home.</i>

642
01:40:22,141 --> 01:40:24,393
<i>Tell Dahl to keep 
it warm for me.</i>

643
01:40:25,144 --> 01:40:26,645
And, Johns,

644
01:40:27,896 --> 01:40:30,023
you keep a strong spine.

645
01:41:17,362 --> 01:41:18,363
Vaako.

646
01:41:21,366 --> 01:41:23,827
- You are still alive. 
- Tell me where.

647
01:41:25,954 --> 01:41:27,831
He's no longer among us.

648
01:41:27,873 --> 01:41:30,876
Tell me, and I'll 
kill him first.

649
01:41:31,460 --> 01:41:32,711
You misunderstand.

650
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:35,839
Vaako is a decent man who 
meant to honor his word.

651
01:41:36,799 --> 01:41:38,759
Even with you, strangely.

652
01:41:38,967 --> 01:41:40,677
I don't care about Furya.

653
01:41:40,719 --> 01:41:43,347
I don't care what the pact 
was between you and him.

654
01:41:43,388 --> 01:41:45,724
This faith cannot 
have a misbeliever

655
01:41:45,766 --> 01:41:47,267
or a kind heart leading it,

656
01:41:47,309 --> 01:41:50,395
and I have done what I have 
done to ensure...

657
01:42:00,322 --> 01:42:01,949
Too many words.

658
01:42:16,922 --> 01:42:19,299
Never lie to me, 
I'll never hurt you.

659
01:42:22,970 --> 01:42:24,429
One word answer.

660
01:42:26,807 --> 01:42:28,308
Is Vaako alive or dead?

661
01:42:33,814 --> 01:42:34,815
Both.

662
01:42:57,963 --> 01:42:59,715
<i>Transcendence.</i>
