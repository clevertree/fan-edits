1
00:00:53,261 --> 00:00:54,721
Come on, one car?

2
00:00:58,308 --> 00:01:01,311
Hey, buddy! Where's the fire?

3
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,188
Got kids living around here.

4
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,570
What?

5
00:03:24,787 --> 00:03:26,956
Twenty minutes ago, an energy surge

6
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,542
knocked out power 
across the entire Pacific Northwest.

7
00:03:29,626 --> 00:03:30,627
What do we know?

8
00:03:30,710 --> 00:03:33,129
Well, our first instinct 
was it was an EMP.

9
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,633
But electromagnetic pulses 
don't have that kind of power.

10
00:03:36,716 --> 00:03:39,302
NASA has ruled out 
meteor strikes or solar flares.

11
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:41,846
The Department of Energy says 
it's not a power plant malfunction.

12
00:03:41,888 --> 00:03:44,766
Well, sounds like we're really good 
at figuring out what it wasn't.

13
00:03:44,849 --> 00:03:47,143
This could be a prelude 
to a larger attack.

14
00:03:47,226 --> 00:03:49,354
I'm suggesting we scramble 
the Fifth and Sixth Regiment.

15
00:03:49,395 --> 00:03:50,563
No, no, no, no.

16
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,191
This needs a much more sophisticated mind.

17
00:03:53,274 --> 00:03:55,068
Someone who understands technology.

18
00:03:55,151 --> 00:03:57,904
- You want to send in a lab rat? 
- Not just any lab rat.

19
00:03:57,987 --> 00:03:59,489
A lab rat with teeth.

20
00:03:59,572 --> 00:04:01,741
You're not suggesting 
who I think you're suggesting.

21
00:04:01,824 --> 00:04:03,576
- I know, he's a little weird. 
- Weird?

22
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,204
- No. No way. 
- He's a psychological tire fire!

23
00:04:06,287 --> 00:04:09,707
But he's also brilliant. 
Five PhDs, IQ off the charts.

24
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:12,460
And his drone tech is revolutionary!

25
00:04:12,543 --> 00:04:14,420
You're sure he can handle this?

26
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,422
He has a perfect operations record.

27
00:04:16,506 --> 00:04:18,424
- Remember the coup in Pakistan? 
- No.

28
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:19,968
Or the uprising in Azerbaijanistan?

29
00:04:20,051 --> 00:04:22,136
- That's not even a country. 
- Exactly.

30
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,430
And you can thank Robotnik for that.

31
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:27,642
I can't believe you're 
bringing that freak into this.

32
00:04:27,725 --> 00:04:30,061
Neither can I, but...

33
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,105
we have no choice.

34
00:04:57,922 --> 00:04:58,923
What the...

35
00:05:21,029 --> 00:05:22,530
Are you in charge here?

36
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,992
You've never seen 
anything like this before.

37
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:30,079
It says I'm the top banana 
in a world full of hungry little monkeys.

38
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:33,458
Allow me to clarify.

39
00:05:33,541 --> 00:05:36,252
In a sequentially ranked hierarchy 
based on level of critical importance,

40
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,421
the disparity between us 
is too vast to quantify.

41
00:05:38,504 --> 00:05:40,798
- Agent Stone? 
- The Doctor thinks you're basic.

42
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:42,967
I'm initiating a sweep sequence.

43
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,636
Ten miles in every direction 
should suffice.

44
00:05:47,472 --> 00:05:49,432
Ah... my babies.

45
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:52,518
Whoo! Look what came out of my egg sac.

46
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:54,687
You know what I love about machines?

47
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:58,983
They do what they're told. 
They follow their programming.

48
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,403
They don't need time off to get drunk 
and put the boat in the water.

49
00:06:03,154 --> 00:06:04,989
Now you do what you're told.

50
00:06:05,073 --> 00:06:07,784
Stand over there on the edge 
of your personal abyss...

51
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,870
and watch my machines do your job.

52
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:16,084
- Can you feel it, Stone? 
- I can feel it, Doctor.

53
00:06:16,751 --> 00:06:19,378
It's evolution, Stone.

54
00:06:19,462 --> 00:06:20,797
It's evolution!

55
00:06:56,833 --> 00:06:58,960
- Agent Stone? 
- Doctor.

56
00:06:59,043 --> 00:07:00,962
Do you see anything useful in this image?

57
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,966
- Nothing at all, Doctor. 
- Of course you don't.

58
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,968
Your eyes weren't 
expertly trained to spot tracks

59
00:07:07,009 --> 00:07:09,595
by the Native American Shadow Wolves.

60
00:07:19,564 --> 00:07:20,690
That's extraordinary.

61
00:07:20,773 --> 00:07:25,570
No. What's extraordinary is, 
I've determined the exact height, weight

62
00:07:25,653 --> 00:07:27,196
and spinal curvature of this creature,

63
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,782
and my computer 
can't find a single match for it

64
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:32,410
anywhere in Earth's animal kingdom.

65
00:07:33,494 --> 00:07:37,081
This blackout was not a terrorist attack, 
and that's no baby bigfoot.

66
00:07:38,082 --> 00:07:41,586
This guy is something else...

67
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,630
entirely.

68
00:07:44,714 --> 00:07:47,467
Divert all search units 
to the site of the footprint.

69
00:07:48,426 --> 00:07:50,928
That's one small step for man,

70
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,306
one giant leap for me.

71
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:06,777
Here we go.

72
00:08:06,861 --> 00:08:08,404
It didn't work out on Earth, 
but that's okay.

73
00:08:08,446 --> 00:08:09,739
You're going to a safe world.

74
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,325
A nice, safe world full of mushrooms.

75
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,578
Mushrooms that'll be your only friends.

76
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:17,580
That sounds awful. I can't do this.

77
00:08:17,663 --> 00:08:19,707
You have to do it. 
There's no other option.

78
00:08:20,708 --> 00:08:22,793
All right.

79
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:26,756
SFPD, pending background check.

80
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:28,341
Paws in the air!

81
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:32,720
Uh, meow?

82
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:39,310
Ow!

83
00:08:41,145 --> 00:08:44,273
"San... Francisco?"

84
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,923
No.

85
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,011
What?

86
00:09:36,409 --> 00:09:37,159
The blue devil.

87
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,467
- Donut Lord? 
- It can talk.

88
00:09:54,135 --> 00:09:56,596
You're not... 
You're not here to abduct me, are you?

89
00:09:56,679 --> 00:09:58,097
You abducted me.

90
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:01,851
Okay, that's a fair point. What are you?

91
00:10:01,934 --> 00:10:03,769
Why are you hiding out in my garage?

92
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,187
I needed somewhere safe.

93
00:10:05,271 --> 00:10:07,648
And you're the only person 
I could think of, Donut Lord.

94
00:10:07,732 --> 00:10:09,066
Why do you keep calling me Donut Lord?

95
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,986
'Cause you talk to donuts. 
And then eat them if they get out of line.

96
00:10:12,528 --> 00:10:13,821
Again, fair.

97
00:10:13,904 --> 00:10:15,323
Wait, wait, wait. 
Where are all the mushrooms?

98
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:16,907
Why am I still on Earth? What is...

99
00:10:16,991 --> 00:10:19,702
Oh, no! I lost my rings.

100
00:10:19,785 --> 00:10:21,078
What?

101
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,378
What's happening? 
Is this your mother ship?

102
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:31,672
I'm not in the mood to get probed.

103
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,467
You think you're worried? 
I'm not even wearing pants.

104
00:10:38,012 --> 00:10:40,222
What the...

105
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:43,392
- They're coming for me! 
- Who's coming for you?

106
00:10:43,434 --> 00:10:44,477
What's that got to do with me?

107
00:10:44,518 --> 00:10:46,437
I don't have time to explain, 
but you have to help me.

108
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,564
No, I don't. Why?

109
00:10:48,647 --> 00:10:52,151
Well, my legs, which normally 
would be classified as lethal weapons,

110
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:53,361
feel like spaghetti.

111
00:10:53,444 --> 00:10:56,238
I need your help. Please. 
It's life or death.

112
00:11:04,205 --> 00:11:05,748
Fine. Come with me.

113
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,181
All right, stay here. And be quiet.

114
00:11:26,227 --> 00:11:27,520
Hello there!

115
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:29,522
Can I help you?

116
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:34,777
Good morning, my rural chum.

117
00:11:36,195 --> 00:11:39,782
I'm... from the power company, 
investigating the blackout.

118
00:11:39,865 --> 00:11:43,202
If you don't mind, I'd like to take 
a few readings inside your house?

119
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:44,954
No kidding? You're from the power company?

120
00:11:44,995 --> 00:11:46,580
- Mmm. 
- Oh, you must know my buddy Spencer.

121
00:11:46,622 --> 00:11:49,375
- We play softball together. 
- Ah! Spence.

122
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:51,460
He's a good man.

123
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:55,005
- Yeah. Come on in! 
- Great.

124
00:11:55,089 --> 00:11:56,465
Take all the readings you need.

125
00:11:56,549 --> 00:11:58,300
Except, uh...

126
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,429
doesn't the power company usually take 
their readings from outside the house?

127
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:03,597
That way they can check them 
even if you're not home.

128
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:06,642
Also, my buddy Spencer 
works for the gas company,

129
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:08,352
and he's more of an Ultimate Frisbee guy.

130
00:12:08,394 --> 00:12:11,021
So, you want to tell me 
why you think I'm dumb enough

131
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,648
to just let you walk inside my house?

132
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:23,826
- I'm sorry, Mister... 
- Wachowski.

133
00:12:23,909 --> 00:12:25,786
But everyone calls me Tom.

134
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:27,747
Except my dentist, he calls me Tim.

135
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:30,791
But it's gone on for so long now 
that it would be weird if I corrected him.

136
00:12:31,459 --> 00:12:33,669
Well, Tom, whose dentist calls him Tim,

137
00:12:33,752 --> 00:12:37,465
you may have noticed that this entire town 
has been experiencing a power outage.

138
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:39,592
Yep, no lights. Picked up on that.

139
00:12:39,675 --> 00:12:42,511
Twenty minutes ago, I tracked 
an energy pulse with a similar signature

140
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,680
to the one that caused that disruption.

141
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:01,530
Listen, uh, Mister...

142
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,990
Doctor.

143
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,743
Dr. Robotnik. But my dentist calls me Rob.

144
00:13:05,826 --> 00:13:07,536
Hmm.

145
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,080
Look, uh, Dr. Robotskeez.

146
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,167
Um, I'm sure what you're here for 
is very serious,

147
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:14,668
but it's got nothing to do with me.

148
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,003
You can ask anyone in town.

149
00:13:16,086 --> 00:13:18,047
- Everyone knows me. 
- I bet they do.

150
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:21,383
I'm sure you're hella popular 
with the Jebs and Merles and Billy Bobs,

151
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:24,053
in this glorified gas-station rest stop.

152
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,263
Betcha go way back 
to the days of tippin' cows

153
00:13:26,347 --> 00:13:28,265
and playin' in a jug band!

154
00:13:31,227 --> 00:13:34,146
And maybe someday you'll achieve your goal

155
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:36,899
of getting a Costco card 
or adopting a Labradoodle.

156
00:13:36,982 --> 00:13:42,571
But the reality is, I surpassed 
everything you're ever going to do...

157
00:13:44,281 --> 00:13:45,449
before I was a toddler.

158
00:13:46,242 --> 00:13:49,453
I was spitting out formulas 
while you were still spitting up formula.

159
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:51,330
I was breastfed, actually.

160
00:13:51,413 --> 00:13:54,416
Nice. Rub that in my orphan face.

161
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,335
Mr. Wachowski,

162
00:13:56,418 --> 00:14:01,131
are you familiar with US Code 904, 
Title 10, Article 104?

163
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,592
- Yeah, who isn't... 
- "Anyone...

164
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:07,429
who attempts to aid an enemy 
of the United States shall suffer death."

165
00:14:08,848 --> 00:14:11,392
And if I'm the one that catches you,

166
00:14:11,475 --> 00:14:12,685
it'll be even worse.

167
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,105
Worse than death?

168
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,577
Compared to what I...

169
00:14:32,329 --> 00:14:33,956
- Old pipes. 
- Yeah.

170
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,499
Probably just the house settling.

171
00:14:35,583 --> 00:14:37,251
Nothing to see here!

172
00:14:38,502 --> 00:14:39,545
Hey!

173
00:14:44,883 --> 00:14:46,302
Here's the thing.

174
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,263
I'm never wrong.

175
00:14:50,014 --> 00:14:52,433
Well, first time for everything, I guess.

176
00:14:52,516 --> 00:14:53,892
Would you like some cake?

177
00:14:53,976 --> 00:14:57,271
I hear raccoons have the cleanest mouths 
of any animal that routinely eats garbage.

178
00:15:09,617 --> 00:15:10,910
Look at that.

179
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,746
I was right.

180
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,081
Note the lack of surprise.

181
00:15:16,165 --> 00:15:17,833
Shall we try this again?

182
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:32,222
I'm going to give you five seconds 
to tell me where it is.

183
00:15:32,306 --> 00:15:33,932
- Five... 
- I don't know what you're talking about.

184
00:15:33,974 --> 00:15:35,392
- Four. 
- Hey, tough guy. I'm a cop,

185
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,810
and you're threatening an officer.

186
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:39,021
How can you threaten somebody 
who never existed?

187
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,522
Three...

188
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:42,441
Come on! Rack your brain.

189
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:47,237
You might be able to come up with some 
lame excuse to go on living, in two...

190
00:15:48,238 --> 00:15:49,281
one.

191
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,492
Wait! Don't hurt him!

192
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,425
Stay behind me.

193
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:23,440
Hiya!

194
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:37,871
Come on! We gotta get out of here.

195
00:16:57,099 --> 00:16:59,309
Doctor! Are you okay?

196
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:01,812
I saw a guy race out of here and thought...

197
00:17:01,895 --> 00:17:03,605
That you should stop them?

198
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:09,111
Whatever this creature is, 
it's our job to secure it,

199
00:17:09,194 --> 00:17:13,115
neutralize it, 
uncover the source of its power.

200
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:14,616
And if it resists...

201
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:18,912
we take it apart... piece by piece.

202
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:22,082
See what makes it tick.

203
00:17:23,459 --> 00:17:24,793
- Stone? 
- Doctor?

204
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,503
Call Optical Illusions.

205
00:17:27,254 --> 00:17:28,839
Tell them I need new frames.

206
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,008
They know what kind I like.

207
00:17:31,759 --> 00:17:34,094
Oh, and bring that quill.

208
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,597
Yes, Doctor.

209
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:42,770
All right, there's 
gonna be rules on this trip.

210
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:45,647
Number one, 
do exactly as I say all the time.

211
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,816
- Got it? 
- Got it, Donut Lord.

212
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:49,526
Would you stop with the "Donut Lord"?

213
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,945
I have a name. It's Tom.

214
00:17:52,571 --> 00:17:53,572
I'm Sonic.

215
00:17:53,655 --> 00:17:55,991
Sonic. Sonic.

216
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:16,095
I'm gonna go check in with Wade, 
see if he knows what's going on.

217
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:17,221
Hello. Green Hills Police Department.

218
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:19,056
- Wade, it's me. 
<i>- Hi.</i>

219
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,432
I'm so glad that you called.

220
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,185
Uh, so, some guys came in 
asking some questions.

221
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:25,270
Uh, they're a little creepy.

222
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:26,313
Wait, what kind of questions?

223
00:18:26,396 --> 00:18:29,775
Um, questions about terrorism?

224
00:18:29,858 --> 00:18:32,986
I told them that 
I've gone ice fishing with Tom.

225
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:34,488
He doesn't know how to make a bomb.

226
00:18:34,571 --> 00:18:36,949
<i>He can't even make bait in the cold.</i>

227
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:39,034
All right, Wade, listen to me. 
This is really important.

228
00:18:39,076 --> 00:18:40,577
Don't tell them that we talked, okay?

229
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:46,208
You know, I think they already know.

230
00:18:48,502 --> 00:18:50,671
Mr. Wachowski.

231
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,214
Tom.

232
00:18:52,297 --> 00:18:54,132
I want you to know 
that the only other person

233
00:18:54,216 --> 00:18:57,427
who ever punched me in the face 
was the school bully.

234
00:18:57,511 --> 00:19:00,055
He hit me in the cafeteria, 
causing a blunt-force contusion

235
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,766
to the soft tissue 
surrounding my orbital bone.

236
00:19:02,850 --> 00:19:04,893
Humiliated me in front of 
the entire school!

237
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,645
And do you know what I did in response?

238
00:19:06,728 --> 00:19:09,857
Uh, I'm assuming that you reported him 
to the principal's office

239
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,859
'cause that kind of behavior 
is really unacceptable.

240
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:15,195
No. I examined the inefficiency of a world 
where brawn trumped brain,

241
00:19:15,279 --> 00:19:18,240
and I used technology 
to resolve that inefficiency.

242
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:21,410
The boy ate his meals 
through a straw for a year.

243
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:23,245
And I have never lost a fight again.

244
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:24,746
Until today.

245
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,498
Hey, hooray for me then, huh?

246
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,418
No, because you're about to become 
the bully with the straw!

247
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:32,087
I'm coming for you, Mr. Wachowski.

248
00:19:32,170 --> 00:19:33,547
And when I catch you, I'll...

249
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:36,091
Hello.

250
00:19:36,175 --> 00:19:37,259
Hello?

251
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:38,927
Hello, hello, hello?

252
00:19:39,011 --> 00:19:42,264
I think he actually hung up, 
because I notice that the light isn't on.

253
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:43,849
Thank you, Officer Brainfart.

254
00:19:43,932 --> 00:19:46,059
If you give me a second, 
I can get an outside line.

255
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:48,353
No. Don't be bothered.

256
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:53,358
You just sit there and be "u"... 'seless.

257
00:20:22,095 --> 00:20:26,850
<i>Thomas Wachowski, accused of committing 
an act of domestic terrorism.</i>

258
00:20:26,934 --> 00:20:29,770
<i>Wachowski is considered 
armed and dangerous.</i>

259
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,730
<i>Any information regarding his whereabouts</i>

260
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:34,566
<i>should be reported to 
local authorities immediately.</i>

261
00:20:40,864 --> 00:20:42,282
Did he say where he was going?

262
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:48,413
Maybe. Maybe not.

263
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,666
Like I'd ever tell you.

264
00:20:52,084 --> 00:20:53,919
Stand down, Agent Stone.

265
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:56,296
This well-meaning citizen 
obviously doesn't understand

266
00:20:56,380 --> 00:20:57,673
the urgency of the matter.

267
00:21:00,592 --> 00:21:01,635
Really?

268
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,057
Now that's 
what I call good cop, bad cop.

269
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:10,227
Hoy!

270
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,020
Left yourself open.

271
00:21:14,606 --> 00:21:16,441
Judging by the quickest route 
to San Francisco,

272
00:21:16,483 --> 00:21:19,653
the approximate speed of their vehicle, 
and local weather conditions...

273
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,698
they should be...

274
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:25,325
right about...

275
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:27,911
here.

276
00:21:27,995 --> 00:21:30,455
- That's brilliant, sir. 
- Thanks...

277
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:32,457
for nothing.

278
00:21:45,887 --> 00:21:49,891
Eeny, meeny, miny...

279
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,893
mayhem.

280
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,452
- Look, I get your poi... 
- Whoa!

281
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:11,079
Yeah!

282
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,759
Sonic!

283
00:22:24,384 --> 00:22:26,970
- Your body! 
- Oh, no, not again!

284
00:22:27,054 --> 00:22:28,096
Hey! Hold on!

285
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,931
- Why? 
- Because I'm gonna do this.

286
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,077
Sonic!

287
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,454
Sonic!

288
00:22:59,044 --> 00:22:59,586
Is that all you got?

289
00:22:59,669 --> 00:23:01,588
No, but thank you for asking.

290
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,011
- Uh-oh. 
- Sonic! Get back in the truck!

291
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:12,724
Ha!

292
00:23:30,450 --> 00:23:31,493
Incoming!

293
00:23:54,391 --> 00:23:56,435
Yes, we did it!

294
00:24:00,981 --> 00:24:03,608
We did not do it. Who <i>is</i> this guy?

295
00:24:03,692 --> 00:24:06,236
Ever wonder where 
your tax dollars are going?

296
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,362
My turn.

297
00:24:07,446 --> 00:24:09,948
Here, just keep us going straight. 
I put it in cruise control.

298
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,841
Ha-ha! Whoo!

299
00:24:28,884 --> 00:24:30,760
Oh!

300
00:24:30,844 --> 00:24:34,139
Give me a big, fat break!

301
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,230
Aw, this one is cute. Let's keep him.

302
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:44,608
Aah!

303
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:56,578
Buzz off.

304
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,288
That doesn't sound good.

305
00:24:58,371 --> 00:25:00,707
- No, beeping is bad. Get rid of it! 
- I'm trying.

306
00:25:00,790 --> 00:25:02,542
Throw it out the win... Throw it anywhere!

307
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,920
- I can't get it off. 
- All right, I'm pulling over.

308
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:13,803
- Did I get it? 
- Nope.

309
00:25:15,972 --> 00:25:17,432
Here. Hold still.

310
00:25:18,683 --> 00:25:20,602
It's going, it's going...

311
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:22,896
It's still here.

312
00:25:25,315 --> 00:25:26,358
Get off me.

313
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:37,077
Sonic!

314
00:25:44,501 --> 00:25:45,669
No, no, no, no, no.

315
00:25:52,592 --> 00:25:56,513
Hey. Come on. You're all right. 
Wake up. Wake up.

316
00:26:03,603 --> 00:26:04,938
Did we get 'em?

317
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,649
Oh. No, there they are.

318
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:10,235
They are real survivors, those two.

319
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:16,741
Can we have a moment?

320
00:26:19,703 --> 00:26:21,121
Pin yourself to the wall.

321
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,833
You know, I won't miss you 
when you're gone.

322
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,795
Human beings are unreliable and stupid, 
and I care very little about them.

323
00:26:28,878 --> 00:26:31,590
But my machines are diligent, relentless.

324
00:26:31,673 --> 00:26:33,508
They're everything to me!

325
00:26:35,468 --> 00:26:36,678
Huh?

326
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,782
Mmm?

327
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:12,881
Come on, buddy.

328
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,342
You're gonna be all right. 
You'll be all right.

329
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:02,574
I just thought you might like a latte 
with steamed Austrian goat milk.

330
00:29:03,491 --> 00:29:05,410
Who do I look like, an imbecile?

331
00:29:05,493 --> 00:29:08,705
Of course I want a latte. 
I love the way you make them!

332
00:29:15,545 --> 00:29:17,881
Ready the prototype.

333
00:29:17,964 --> 00:29:19,716
With this kind of power,

334
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:23,720
my machines can finally reach 
their full potential.

335
00:29:30,226 --> 00:29:31,895
He's gonna be okay, Jojo.

336
00:29:33,188 --> 00:29:35,982
Oh, thank God. He's gonna be okay, right?

337
00:29:36,065 --> 00:29:38,568
I'm a vet, Tom. I don't even know 
what I'm looking at here.

338
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,778
He's a hedgehog. Or so he says.

339
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:42,530
- It talks? 
- Almost constantly.

340
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,241
Okay.

341
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:47,160
- Holy... 
- What?

342
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,703
His pulse is super-fast.

343
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,622
That actually might be normal for him.

344
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,332
I don't know. You gotta help him, Maddie.

345
00:29:52,415 --> 00:29:54,167
I don't know his physiology.

346
00:29:54,250 --> 00:29:56,794
He doesn't seem to have any broken bones.

347
00:29:56,878 --> 00:29:59,088
He's just really banged up.

348
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,593
Oh, look at his poor little feet.

349
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:09,432
Hang in there, buddy. 
You're gonna be all right.

350
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,187
- So, this is it? 
- That's it. That's your pyramid.

351
00:30:14,270 --> 00:30:16,356
Wow, look at that thing!

352
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:17,607
What happens now?

353
00:30:18,483 --> 00:30:21,110
- Oh. He's... gone. 
- Yep.

354
00:30:22,445 --> 00:30:24,822
No good. You need a special key 
to get to the roof.

355
00:30:25,865 --> 00:30:27,200
What now?

356
00:30:27,825 --> 00:30:30,620
Time for me to abuse 
the power entrusted to me.

357
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,048
We got a jumper on the roof.

358
00:30:42,131 --> 00:30:45,009
Gotta get up there fast or we're gonna 
have a human pancake on our hands.

359
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,303
You came all the way from Montana.

360
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,139
Yeah. That's how serious it is.

361
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,020
Okay.

362
00:30:57,897 --> 00:30:59,232
You just saved a life.

363
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:10,827
All right. What are we looking for?

364
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,498
This.

365
00:31:16,332 --> 00:31:18,293
Okay. What happens now?

366
00:31:18,376 --> 00:31:20,211
Now all I have to do 
is think of where I want

367
00:31:20,295 --> 00:31:22,422
the other end of the ring 
to appear, and I throw it.

368
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:24,549
So that's it? We did it?

369
00:31:24,632 --> 00:31:25,967
Yeah. We did it!

370
00:31:26,301 --> 00:31:27,719

- All right.

371
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:30,889
- Um, you gotta go, right? 
- Yeah, I gotta go.

372
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,181
I gotta go. We gotta go too.

373
00:31:32,265 --> 00:31:33,850
See... All right, bye-bye.

374
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:19,854
Welcome to San Francisco, Mr. Wachowski.

375
00:32:20,938 --> 00:32:22,732
Are you enjoying the clam chowder?

376
00:32:22,815 --> 00:32:25,026
It's the government wack job 
who keeps trying to kill us.

377
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,527
Unsuccessfully!

378
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,529
Nice of you to swing by 
on your way to Comic-Con.

379
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:29,781
Yeah, what are you wearing?

380
00:32:31,949 --> 00:32:36,287
It's a flight suit, designed to modulate 
my body temperature and reduce drag.

381
00:32:36,371 --> 00:32:37,956
Yeah, and yet you still are one.

382
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:39,832
Ooh-hoo! Good one.

383
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:41,876
You are catching fire, Thomas.

384
00:32:41,959 --> 00:32:44,337
Oh, and speaking of heat, 
I see you've taken a lover.

385
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:46,047
Does she have a name

386
00:32:46,130 --> 00:32:48,549
or should we just call her 
"collateral damage"?

387
00:32:48,633 --> 00:32:49,759
Hey, watch your mouth.

388
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,344
Unless you want a little more 
of what I gave you earlier?

389
00:32:52,303 --> 00:32:53,638
I punched him in the face.

390
00:32:53,638 --> 00:32:56,307
The time for talking is over! 
It's time to push buttons.

391
00:33:10,405 --> 00:33:12,532
I was not expecting that.

392
00:33:12,615 --> 00:33:15,326
But I was expecting not to expect 
something, so it doesn't count.

393
00:33:58,077 --> 00:33:59,746
Pew, pew-pew-pew, pew-pew-pew-pew!

394
00:34:03,833 --> 00:34:06,669
Oh!

395
00:34:25,897 --> 00:34:28,316
Whoa, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!

396
00:34:37,575 --> 00:34:38,451
Aah.

397
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:42,080
Can I give you one genius piece of advice?

398
00:34:43,456 --> 00:34:45,082
Don't run.

399
00:34:45,166 --> 00:34:47,502
It'll only hurt more if you do.

400
00:34:47,585 --> 00:34:49,879
And it's bad for your joints. 
They've proved it.

401
00:34:49,962 --> 00:34:52,298
All right, Eggman. You wanna get fast?

402
00:34:52,381 --> 00:34:53,549
Let's get fast.

403
00:34:56,803 --> 00:34:58,179
The hard way it is.

404
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,116
That was an illegal left, by the way.

405
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,096
How is this possible?

406
00:35:40,179 --> 00:35:42,265
No one's ever caught up to me before.

407
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,899
Coming through!

408
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:52,984
<i>Sacrebleu!</i>

409
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:56,279
<i>Excusez-moi, monsieur!</i>

410
00:36:00,241 --> 00:36:02,493
Here we go. Room to open it up.

411
00:36:11,752 --> 00:36:13,004
I can't lose him!

412
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,398
Lost visual contact.

413
00:36:37,445 --> 00:36:41,115
You're not allowed up there! 
It's one of the Seven Wonders!

414
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:06,974
Get out of here!

415
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:18,152
You're an astonishing little creature.

416
00:37:20,404 --> 00:37:22,657
It'll be fun to take you back to the lab

417
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,992
for a litany of invasive 
exploratory procedures.

418
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,620
Any last words?

419
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:31,332
Guac. I like that word.

420
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:35,378
I don't have to tell you how 
many scientific breakthroughs

421
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:37,797
have been made possible by animal testing.

422
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,965
You're being very selfish.

423
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:40,216
Going my way?

424
00:37:40,299 --> 00:37:41,509
What the...

425
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,891
Who the hell do you think you are?

426
00:37:52,228 --> 00:37:53,729
I'm the Donut Lord, you son of a...

427
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,569
Autopilot, adjust.

428
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,738
Why?

429
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:06,117
Why would you throw 
your life away for this thing?

430
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,576
That's why I don't have friends.

431
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,745
Next thing you know, 
you're somebody's best man.

432
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,372
They want to have the wedding out of town.

433
00:38:11,414 --> 00:38:13,457
Like nobody has anything better to do!

434
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:16,335
Anyway, where were we?

435
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:18,963
Oh, yes. You were about to die.

436
00:38:21,215 --> 00:38:22,925
That's our sheriff you're messing with.

437
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:25,553
I don't mean to be indelicate here,

438
00:38:25,636 --> 00:38:29,056
but someone should get some ice, 
keep the body fresh.

439
00:38:32,059 --> 00:38:34,312
He's just a silly little alien.

440
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,230
He didn't belong here!

441
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:02,506
Everyone, get back!

442
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:08,929
I think you have something 
that belongs to me.

443
00:39:09,722 --> 00:39:10,723
Whoa.

444
00:40:16,747 --> 00:40:18,874
Ooh! Now you've done it!

445
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:18,976
- I think these belong to you. 


446
00:41:21,896 --> 00:41:24,982
- You did pretty good, space hog. 
- Thanks, Donut Lord.

447
00:41:25,357 --> 00:41:27,818
All right, everybody. Nothing to see here.

448
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:28,986
Let's disperse.

449
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,946
Just another ordinary day in Green Hills.

450
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:42,958
My grasp on sanity remains... absolute.

451
00:41:44,710 --> 00:41:46,253
Isn't that right, Agent Stone?

452
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:53,594
Why don't you get a head start?

453
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:58,682
Do some rock-connaissance.

454
00:41:58,766 --> 00:42:01,685
Rock-connaissance! 
Come on! That's hilarious!

455
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:03,520
What's the matter with you?

456
00:42:03,604 --> 00:42:06,815
Here's the "sitch." Uninhabited planet.

457
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:12,363
No resources, no supplies, 
no apparent way home.

458
00:42:14,907 --> 00:42:16,492
A lesser man would die here.

459
00:42:19,787 --> 00:42:21,455
I'll be home by Christmas.

460
00:42:41,100 --> 00:42:43,018
Rock-connaissance!

461
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,107
Come on! Cheer up!

462
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,564
If these readings are accurate, he's here.

463
00:44:52,648 --> 00:44:53,941
I found him.

464
00:44:54,024 --> 00:44:55,818
I just hope I'm not too late.
