1
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:57,547
Oh, my God.

2
00:04:57,714 --> 00:04:59,590
Are you okay?

3
00:05:00,717 --> 00:05:02,844
Do you want me to call 911?

4
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:08,891
What are you-?

5
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:15,249
You, in the silver Lexus. Slow down.

6
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:17,752
Slow down and pull over immediately.

7
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:34,268
Lady, have you any idea 
how fast you were going?

8
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:36,395
Let me see your license and registration.

9
00:06:39,857 --> 00:06:43,402
- Okay, what have we got? 
- This new computer virus is tricky.

10
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:47,281
It's infected half the civilian Internet 
as well as secondary military apps.

11
00:06:47,448 --> 00:06:50,243
- Payroll, inventory. 
- Primary defense nets are still clean?

12
00:06:50,535 --> 00:06:52,662
So far the firewalls are holding up.

13
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:56,624
Sir, the Pentagon has proposed we use 
our Al to scan the infrastructure.

14
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:59,252
Search and destroy 
for any hint of the virus.

15
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:02,755
I know, Tony, but that's like 
going after a fly with a bazooka.

16
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:05,550
Once the connection's made, 
it should only be a few minutes.

17
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:10,096
During which we've put everything under 
the control of a single computer system.

18
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:13,057
The most intelligent system 
ever conceived.

19
00:07:13,224 --> 00:07:16,227
I still prefer to keep humans in the loop.

20
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,521
I'm not sure Skynet's ready.

21
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,606
Yes, sir.

22
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,160
Thanks.

23
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,082
Welcome to Jim's Burgers. 
Can I take your order?

24
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:11,003
- Jose Barrera? 
- Yeah, that's me.

25
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:33,192
Growing concern over widespread outages 
in the global digital network...

26
00:11:33,484 --> 00:11:36,821
...have prompted rumors 
of a new computer super-virus.

27
00:11:36,987 --> 00:11:40,533
- Wall Street analysts are confident... 
- Shit! My mom's home.

28
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,786
Here. Hide the beer. Hide the beer. 
Here. Take that.

29
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,872
Go, go, go.

30
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:55,464
Elizabeth and William Anderson?

31
00:11:56,173 --> 00:12:00,594
I'm Bill. My sister's upstairs. 
Is there something wrong?

32
00:12:13,607 --> 00:12:15,234
What's going on?

33
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:18,612
I have to go to the clinic. 
It's an emergency.

34
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:20,948
It's 4:30 in the morning.

35
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,869
Well, I'll be back before you get up.

36
00:13:08,245 --> 00:13:10,831
Cool it, guys, it's just me.

37
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,418
We've got a sick cat coming in.

38
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,447
Please, don't do that.

39
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,703
I suppose it was you who 
ripped us off last week.

40
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:52,706
Put the phone down.

41
00:13:53,833 --> 00:13:55,793
Sorry.

42
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:57,670
I just...

43
00:13:57,837 --> 00:13:59,964
I needed some medicine.

44
00:14:00,130 --> 00:14:03,717
There's an emergency clinic 
half a mile away.

45
00:14:03,884 --> 00:14:05,469
Can't do that.

46
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:12,977
How much did you take?

47
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:14,895
- Enough. 
- Well...

48
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:18,732
...this is the stuff we use 
to chemically neuter dogs.

49
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:23,028
Take a look.

50
00:14:24,989 --> 00:14:26,365
Hey!

51
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:34,039
Jesus! You didn't have to do that!

52
00:14:34,873 --> 00:14:37,376
Next time bring a clue, 
not a paintball gun.

53
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:41,046
- No, this isn't what you think. 
- Yeah, right.

54
00:15:21,712 --> 00:15:23,422
You're John Connor.

55
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:31,180
I'm Kate Brewster.

56
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,685
We went to 
West Hills Junior High together.

57
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:44,360
- Jesus. 
- What happened to you, John?

58
00:15:44,735 --> 00:15:48,656
Middle of eighth grade, 
you just disappeared.

59
00:15:48,822 --> 00:15:52,159
And there was that thing 
about your foster parents.

60
00:15:52,409 --> 00:15:55,037
Yeah, they were murdered.

61
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:59,541
I didn't do it.

62
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,003
What the hell?

63
00:16:03,212 --> 00:16:05,798
Is somebody with you?

64
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:29,697
Katherine Brewster?

65
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:47,923
No.

66
00:18:37,741 --> 00:18:40,828
John Connor was here. 
Where did he go?

67
00:18:41,578 --> 00:18:44,289
Tell me. Where did he go?

68
00:19:24,121 --> 00:19:25,497
Katherine Brewster?

69
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:32,754
What are you doing? Let me down!

70
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:36,341
Let me down! Let me down!

71
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:40,178
Where is John Connor?

72
00:19:41,179 --> 00:19:43,473
He's...

73
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:46,810
...in the kennel, in a cage.

74
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:56,069
Please, please, please. 
You have to let me go!

75
00:20:43,867 --> 00:20:46,912
John Connor.

76
00:20:48,538 --> 00:20:51,250
It is time.

77
00:20:52,125 --> 00:20:54,878
You here to kill me?

78
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:03,762
No. You must live.

79
00:21:14,564 --> 00:21:18,402
- Why are you here? Where are we going? 
- Keep moving.

80
00:21:21,154 --> 00:21:23,448
Get out of here.

81
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:26,284
Now!

82
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:17,627
- No pulse. 
- See if you can get him down.

83
00:22:19,296 --> 00:22:21,173
I can't.

84
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,341
This guy weighs a ton.

85
00:22:47,824 --> 00:22:51,119
- 911. 
- Yes. Yes. I'm being kidnapped.

86
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,831
- Where are you now? 
- I don't know where. I'm in my truck.

87
00:22:55,165 --> 00:22:57,501
It's a Toyota Tundra.

88
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:03,090
It says "Emery Animal Hospital" 
on the side. I'm locked inside the back.

89
00:23:04,174 --> 00:23:05,509
Hello?

90
00:23:06,385 --> 00:23:08,720
Hello?

91
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:13,433
Shit! Shit!

92
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:28,967
Get off.

93
00:24:45,192 --> 00:24:46,151
Let me out!

94
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,028
What are you doing here?

95
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,739
You tell me. You got me into this.

96
00:24:51,198 --> 00:24:53,408
- Stop the car. 
- I can't. Not yet.

97
00:24:53,575 --> 00:24:57,621
- You bastard! Stop the car! 
- Shut up!

98
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,635
Son of a bitch.

99
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:14,221
Goddamn it.

100
00:25:14,638 --> 00:25:16,473
What are you doing?

101
00:25:16,848 --> 00:25:19,726
If you don't have insurance, 
I'm gonna rip your balls off.

102
00:25:19,017 --> 00:25:21,353
- I don't want any problems, okay? 
- Shut up!

103
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:25,106
- I'm being kidnapped! Call the police! 
- Well, I'll be goddamned.

104
00:25:25,273 --> 00:25:27,108
- Call 911! 
- A cop when you need one.

105
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,110
Help, please! Please!

106
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:32,113
Let me out of here! Help!

107
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:37,577
Get back here, asshole!

108
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:02,477
That's the cops! 
You have to pull over!

109
00:26:02,644 --> 00:26:04,271
Yeah, first chance I get.

110
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,338
Hold on!

111
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,493
Stop it!

112
00:29:29,225 --> 00:29:30,560
I'll drive.

113
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:38,985
Get out.

114
00:30:35,583 --> 00:30:37,627
Excuse me.

115
00:31:21,963 --> 00:31:23,214
Move over.

116
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,197
Do you even remember me?

117
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:52,869
Sarah Connor? Blowing up Cyberdyne?

118
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,414
"Hasta la vista, baby. " 
Ring any bells?

119
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:59,083
That was a different T-101.

120
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,961
What, do you come off an assembly line 
or something?

121
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:03,338
Exactly.

122
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:07,467
Oh, man. I'm gonna have 
to teach you everything all over again.

123
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,513
Katherine Brewster, 
have you sustained injury?

124
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,350
Drop dead, you asshole!

125
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,062
I'm unable to comply.

126
00:32:28,321 --> 00:32:30,114
Where are you taking me?

127
00:32:30,281 --> 00:32:32,450
To a safe location.

128
00:32:49,050 --> 00:32:51,636
All right, get off at the next exit. 
Let her out.

129
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:55,014
Negative. 
Katherine Brewster must be protected.

130
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:58,810
- I thought I was the one they were after. 
- You could not be located.

131
00:32:59,018 --> 00:33:03,481
So a T-X was sent back through time 
to eliminate your lieutenants.

132
00:33:04,565 --> 00:33:08,486
So she's gonna be in the Resistance?

133
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,826
No, no. 
No, you shouldn't even exist.

134
00:33:15,034 --> 00:33:17,537
I mean, 
we took out Cyberdyne over 10 years ago.

135
00:33:17,704 --> 00:33:21,541
- We stopped Judgment Day. 
- You only postponed it.

136
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,918
Judgment Day is inevitable.

137
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:33,428
I require a cutting tool.

138
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,645
Here, take the wheel.

139
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,485
- What are you doing? 
- I am powered by two hydrogen fuel cells.

140
00:33:49,652 --> 00:33:52,947
My primary cell was damaged 
by a plasma attack.

141
00:33:53,239 --> 00:33:57,243
T- X is designed for extreme combat, 
driven by a plasma reactor...

142
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:59,370
...and equipped with onboard weapons.

143
00:33:58,661 --> 00:34:00,872
Its arsenal includes...

144
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:03,624
...nanotechnological transjectors.

145
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:07,670
- Meaning? 
- It can control other machines.

146
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:14,802
Its body chassis is heavily armored 
and hardened to withstand external attack.

147
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:19,932
My presence in this timeline 
has been anticipated.

148
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:24,520
T- X is designed to terminate 
other cybernetic organisms.

149
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,291
When ruptured, 
the fuel cells become unstable.

150
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,085
Relax.

151
00:34:47,293 --> 00:34:48,503
- Let me out of here!

152
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:33,840
Hey.

153
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,759
Hey! Are you gonna pay for that?

154
00:35:41,138 --> 00:35:42,223
Talk to the hand.

155
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:42,974
Talk to the hand.

156
00:35:59,407 --> 00:36:02,201
Help! Help me!

157
00:36:02,702 --> 00:36:04,370
Help!

158
00:36:08,082 --> 00:36:10,167
I think we better go.

159
00:36:42,241 --> 00:36:43,826
Jerky?

160
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:46,120
You're kidnapping me.

161
00:36:47,914 --> 00:36:50,291
- Look- 
- God, you were always a delinquent.

162
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:54,378
And look at you now, sitting there 
like the bad boy thing still works.

163
00:36:54,545 --> 00:36:57,423
What are you, 
some kind of gang member?

164
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,009
How do you live with yourself?

165
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,804
What?

166
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,852
Tell her who I am.

167
00:37:10,061 --> 00:37:15,733
John Connor is leader of the Worldwide 
Resistance and last hope of humankind.

168
00:37:17,276 --> 00:37:19,695
Right. And him?

169
00:37:20,696 --> 00:37:23,115
He's a robot from the future.

170
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:26,953
Living tissue over a metal skeleton, 
sent back in time to protect me.

171
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,913
Go to hell.

172
00:37:29,664 --> 00:37:32,250
He doesn't mean you any harm.

173
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,852
Hi, I'm Detective Edwards, L.A.P.D. 
This is Detective Bell.

174
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:55,189
We're looking for Katherine Brewster. 
Is she here?

175
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:56,565
No.

176
00:37:56,732 --> 00:38:01,112
- You're her fiance, Scott Mason? 
- Yes.

177
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,157
There was an incident at the 
veterinary hospital where she works.

178
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,035
We're concerned something 
may have happened to her.

179
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:09,370
Where is she?

180
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,081
We got a report from a gas station 
attendant near Victorville...

181
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:17,086
...about a possible kidnapping 
and it might be related.

182
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:19,547
I'll help you find her.

183
00:38:31,559 --> 00:38:33,269
Come with me.

184
00:38:37,857 --> 00:38:39,317
Go.

185
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,929
Your mother?

186
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,393
I never even knew 
where she was buried.

187
00:39:17,313 --> 00:39:20,191
I hit the road the day she died.

188
00:39:24,070 --> 00:39:26,364
Why did you bring me here?

189
00:39:30,326 --> 00:39:31,786
No! What are you doing?

190
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,496
Hey, stop!

191
00:39:33,746 --> 00:39:35,039
Get away from it! Stop!

192
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,299
Sarah Connor was cremated in Mexico.

193
00:39:45,466 --> 00:39:47,760
Her friends scattered her ashes 
in the sea.

194
00:39:48,135 --> 00:39:51,388
They stored these weapons 
in accordance with her will.

195
00:39:56,936 --> 00:39:58,979
"Every day after this one is a gift. "

196
00:39:59,188 --> 00:40:02,024
She told me, "We made it. We're free. "

197
00:40:04,860 --> 00:40:07,488
But I never really believed that.

198
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:12,952
I guess she didn't either.

199
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:18,457
You know you were about 
the closest thing to a father I ever had?

200
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,419
How pathetic is that?

201
00:40:22,962 --> 00:40:24,171
Out of my way!

202
00:40:27,550 --> 00:40:29,552
My mission is to protect you.

203
00:40:30,428 --> 00:40:31,720
That's enough.

204
00:40:33,305 --> 00:40:36,725
Move or I'll do it! 
I swear I will! I'll shoot you!

205
00:40:36,725 --> 00:40:40,062
Go ahead. See what happens.

206
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:56,495
Don't do that.

207
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:00,624
Oh, my God.

208
00:41:06,755 --> 00:41:10,092
This is the police. 
We have the building surrounded.

209
00:41:10,259 --> 00:41:12,428
Release your hostage!

210
00:41:33,824 --> 00:41:35,868
Perps still holed up?

211
00:41:36,994 --> 00:41:38,078
Gotcha.

212
00:41:38,245 --> 00:41:40,789
Good news. Your fiancee's okay.

213
00:41:40,956 --> 00:41:42,041
Where is she?

214
00:41:42,208 --> 00:41:44,710
Greenlawn Cemetery, 
up off the 5 freeway.

215
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:48,881
It's right by the desert. 
But they're gonna bring her back to the-

216
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,301
Oh, my God! Oh, my dear Jesus! God!

217
00:42:16,158 --> 00:42:19,620
You're safe now. They can't hurt you.

218
00:42:20,204 --> 00:42:23,374
Kate, my name is Dr. Silberman.

219
00:42:23,540 --> 00:42:26,877
I'm a post-trauma counselor 
for the sheriff's department.

220
00:42:27,044 --> 00:42:29,046
How are you feeling?

221
00:42:29,838 --> 00:42:31,840
He's not human.

222
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:36,345
He's really not human.

223
00:42:38,764 --> 00:42:42,226
I know what it's like to be 
in a hostage situation.

224
00:42:42,434 --> 00:42:44,478
I've been there myself.

225
00:42:44,645 --> 00:42:47,773
The fear, the adrenaline.

226
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:51,860
You find yourself imagining things.

227
00:42:52,403 --> 00:42:54,947
Impossible things.

228
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,866
Crazy things.

229
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:01,370
Insane things.

230
00:43:03,330 --> 00:43:06,208
Take years to get over it.

231
00:43:07,459 --> 00:43:09,878
- Go, go, go! 
- Move it!

232
00:43:15,551 --> 00:43:16,844
Drop your weapon!

233
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:22,641
And the coffin!

234
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,479
Take him down! Take him down!

235
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,439
Resume fire!

236
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:19,907
We must reacquire Katherine Brewster.

237
00:44:20,699 --> 00:44:23,619
Why? What makes her 
so goddamn important?

238
00:44:23,786 --> 00:44:28,123
Through her, you contact remnants of the 
military and learn how to fight Skynet...

239
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:30,793
...forming the core 
of the Resistance.

240
00:45:29,017 --> 00:45:30,727
Get in!

241
00:45:30,894 --> 00:45:32,396
Do you want to live? Come on!

242
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:58,130
- It was Scott! How could it be Scott? 
- Your fiance?

243
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:02,301
The T-X is polymimetic, 
able to take the form of anything it touches.

244
00:46:03,093 --> 00:46:05,137
Your fiance is dead.

245
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:30,746
Oh, my God!

246
00:46:36,418 --> 00:46:37,544
Do something!

247
00:47:08,575 --> 00:47:10,285
Get down.

248
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,018
We need a new vehicle.

249
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,478
Hey, come on.

250
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,772
We gotta keep moving.

251
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,526
She killed Scott because of me.

252
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:15,577
Look, I know this won't help...

253
00:49:17,788 --> 00:49:23,377
...but sometimes things happen 
that we just can't change.

254
00:49:27,339 --> 00:49:28,882
It's not your fault.

255
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,687
So this Terminatrix, how many others 
does she have on her hit list?

256
00:49:42,104 --> 00:49:46,775
Twenty-two. Anderson, Elizabeth. 
Anderson, William.

257
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:49,695
Barrera, Jose. Brewster, Robert.

258
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:51,154
My father?

259
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:56,326
Having failed to acquire its primary target, 
T- X will resume its default program.

260
00:49:56,493 --> 00:50:00,580
- She's gonna kill my father too? 
- There's a high probability.

261
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,667
- No. 
- Who is he? What does he do?

262
00:50:03,834 --> 00:50:08,338
He's in the Air Force. Weapon design, 
secret stuff. I don't know, exactly.

263
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:12,300
General Robert Brewster 
is program director of CRS...

264
00:50:12,467 --> 00:50:16,388
...Cyber Research Systems, 
autonomous weapons division.

265
00:50:16,555 --> 00:50:19,474
Skynet. You're talking about Skynet.

266
00:50:19,641 --> 00:50:23,937
Skynet is one of the digital defense systems 
developed under Brewster.

267
00:50:24,104 --> 00:50:25,605
Oh, God.

268
00:50:26,022 --> 00:50:29,234
Oh, my God. Of course.

269
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:31,069
It all makes sense now.

270
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:35,365
If you hadn't come back when I was a kid, 
changed everything...

271
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:39,619
...she and I would have gotten together 
then. I would have met her father.

272
00:50:39,995 --> 00:50:42,414
- Don't you see? 
- I don't understand.

273
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:46,543
Your father. 
This is all about your father.

274
00:50:46,710 --> 00:50:51,298
He's the key. He always was. Your father 
is the one who can shut Skynet down.

275
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:55,177
He's the only one who ever could.

276
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,222
We have to get to him 
before the T-X does.

277
00:50:59,431 --> 00:51:03,935
- Negative. I cannot jeopardize my mission. 
- This is your mission, to save people!

278
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:08,064
My mission is to ensure the survival 
of John Connor and Katherine Brewster.

279
00:51:08,815 --> 00:51:11,109
I am giving you an order.

280
00:51:11,276 --> 00:51:13,862
I am not programmed 
to follow your orders.

281
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:17,115
- After the nuclear war, you both- 
- Nuclear war?!

282
00:51:17,282 --> 00:51:20,368
There doesn't have to be a war! 
We can stop it!

283
00:51:20,535 --> 00:51:22,746
There is insufficient time.

284
00:51:22,913 --> 00:51:27,084
The first launch sequences 
will be initiated at 6:18 p. m.

285
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:29,002
- What, today? 
- Affirmative.

286
00:51:29,169 --> 00:51:31,880
John, what is he saying?

287
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,008
Judgment Day.

288
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:38,595
The end of the world.

289
00:51:39,971 --> 00:51:41,932
It's today, three hours from now.

290
00:51:42,390 --> 00:51:44,392
Two hours and 53 minutes.

291
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:49,648
We must continue south into Mexico 
to escape the primary blast zones.

292
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,193
No, we have to get to her dad.

293
00:51:54,861 --> 00:51:58,782
The Mojave area will sustain 
significant nuclear fallout.

294
00:51:58,949 --> 00:52:00,575
You will not survive.

295
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:05,747
You mean we go run and hide somewhere 
in a hole while the bombs fall?

296
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,082
It is your destiny.

297
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:14,089
Please do what he says. 
You have to save my father!

298
00:52:18,301 --> 00:52:21,805
We can reach CRS 
in approximately one hour...

299
00:52:22,013 --> 00:52:24,766
...depending on traffic conditions.

300
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,242
I can't get a line.

301
00:52:45,328 --> 00:52:47,163
The whole cell network is down.

302
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:50,250
Skynet is assuming control 
over global communications...

303
00:52:50,417 --> 00:52:52,752
...in preparation for its attack.

304
00:52:52,919 --> 00:52:57,090
So if this war is between people 
and machines...

305
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:59,634
...why are you on our side?

306
00:52:59,801 --> 00:53:03,722
The Resistance captured me 
and reprogrammed my CPU.

307
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:07,392
I was originally designed 
for assassination missions.

308
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:11,855
So...

309
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:16,067
...you don't really care 
if this mission succeeds or not.

310
00:53:16,651 --> 00:53:20,614
If we get killed, 
does that mean anything to you?

311
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:24,034
If you were to die, 
I will become useless.

312
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,329
There will be no reason for me to exist.

313
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,045
Thank you for doing this.

314
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,214
Your gratitude is not required.

315
00:53:37,923 --> 00:53:40,342
I am programmed 
to follow your commands.

316
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:42,719
Her commands?

317
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:48,266
Katherine Brewster had me reactivated and 
sent through the time displacement field.

318
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,268
Why didn't I send you back?

319
00:53:50,435 --> 00:53:52,729
I am not authorized 
to answer your question.

320
00:53:54,522 --> 00:53:57,984
- Why didn't he send you back? 
- He was dead.

321
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,282
Well, that sucks.

322
00:54:05,200 --> 00:54:09,120
- Humans inevitably die. 
- Yeah, I know.

323
00:54:10,038 --> 00:54:12,123
So how does it-? No.

324
00:54:12,582 --> 00:54:15,377
Maybe I don't want to know.

325
00:54:16,962 --> 00:54:18,463
How does he die?

326
00:54:19,172 --> 00:54:22,968
John Connor was terminated 
on July 4th, 2032.

327
00:54:23,134 --> 00:54:27,013
I was selected for the emotional attachment 
he had for my model number...

328
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:31,476
...due to his boyhood experiences. 
This aided in my infiltration.

329
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,062
What are you saying?

330
00:54:35,855 --> 00:54:38,191
I killed you.

331
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:55,458
This has to be a mistake. As of 1100 hours, 
all primary military systems were secure.

332
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:59,713
They were. Only the civilian sector 
was affected. Internet, air traffic.

333
00:54:59,879 --> 00:55:02,674
Minutes ago, guidance computers 
at Vandenberg crashed.

334
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:05,552
We thought it was an error. 
It looks like the virus.

335
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:09,973
- Early warning in Alaska is down. 
- Satellite signals are scrambled.

336
00:55:10,140 --> 00:55:13,018
What about the missile silos, the subs?

337
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:16,229
We've lost contact.

338
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:20,150
You're saying this country 
is completely open to attack.

339
00:55:20,316 --> 00:55:23,153
Theoretically, we could be 
under attack already.

340
00:55:23,319 --> 00:55:28,783
Who's doing this? A foreign power 
or some computer hacker in his garage?

341
00:55:28,950 --> 00:55:31,077
We can't trace the virus 
or pin it down.

342
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:35,373
It keeps growing and changing, 
like it has a mind of its own.

343
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,667
This can't be happening.

344
00:55:37,834 --> 00:55:42,047
The Pentagon's on the secure line. 
It's the chairman.

345
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,218
All right.

346
00:56:01,649 --> 00:56:03,568
Look...

347
00:56:03,943 --> 00:56:05,862
...none of this is gonna happen.

348
00:56:06,488 --> 00:56:11,910
We get to your dad, get him to pull the plug 
on Skynet. The bombs won't fall.

349
00:56:14,287 --> 00:56:17,123
He won't have to kill me someday.

350
00:56:17,874 --> 00:56:20,210
He'll never even exist.

351
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:27,217
You and I, we can 
just go our separate ways.

352
00:56:52,742 --> 00:56:55,370
We're hoping you have a solution for us.

353
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:59,332
I know, sir, but Skynet is not ready 
for a system-wide connection.

354
00:56:59,499 --> 00:57:02,460
That's not what your civilian 
counterparts there told me.

355
00:57:02,627 --> 00:57:04,921
They say we can stop this damn virus.

356
00:57:05,088 --> 00:57:08,591
I understand there's a certain amount 
of performance anxiety...

357
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:12,095
...but your boys say if we plug Skynet 
into all of our systems...

358
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:16,349
...it'll squash this thing and give me back 
control of my military.

359
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:19,018
Mr. Chairman, I need 
to make myself very clear.

360
00:57:19,185 --> 00:57:22,605
If we uplink now, Skynet will be 
in control of your military.

361
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:26,818
But you'll be in control of Skynet, right?

362
00:57:27,152 --> 00:57:29,279
That is correct, sir.

363
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:30,822
Then do it.

364
00:57:30,989 --> 00:57:33,741
And Brewster, if this thing works...

365
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:37,287
...you'll get all the funding 
you'll ever need.

366
00:57:38,246 --> 00:57:40,165
Yes, sir.

367
00:58:48,775 --> 00:58:50,401
Sir?

368
00:58:51,653 --> 00:58:53,404
Shall I?

369
00:58:54,948 --> 00:58:56,491
No.

370
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:59,827
It's my job now.

371
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:17,345
- Skynet Defense System activated. 
- We're in.

372
00:59:17,512 --> 00:59:20,723
We're past the firewalls, local 
defense nets, Minutemen, subs.

373
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:25,019
Skynet's fully operational, 
processing at 60 teraflops a second.

374
00:59:25,228 --> 00:59:29,065
It should take less than a minute 
to find the virus and kill it.

375
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:33,027
Let's pray to God this works.

376
00:59:39,284 --> 00:59:40,451
Power failure?

377
00:59:40,618 --> 00:59:42,954
No. I don't know what it is.

378
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,426
What the hell is going on?

379
00:59:56,593 --> 00:59:57,635
Daddy!

380
00:59:58,177 --> 00:59:59,721
What are you doing here?

381
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:08,896
Daddy! Get away from it!

382
01:00:12,692 --> 01:00:14,235
Watch out!

383
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:33,379
Daddy, don't move.

384
01:00:37,759 --> 01:00:39,469
She'll be back.

385
01:00:40,136 --> 01:00:42,096
We have to shut down Skynet.

386
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:44,932
Where's the system core? 
In this building?

387
01:00:45,099 --> 01:00:48,895
Skynet. The virus has infected Skynet.

388
01:00:49,062 --> 01:00:52,190
Skynet is the virus! 
It's why everything's falling apart!

389
01:00:52,357 --> 01:00:54,484
Skynet has become self-aware.

390
01:00:54,651 --> 01:00:58,279
In one hour it will initiate 
a massive nuclear attack on its enemy.

391
01:00:58,488 --> 01:00:59,572
What enemy?

392
01:01:00,156 --> 01:01:01,574
Us!

393
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:03,076
Humans.

394
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:15,463
Oh, God! It's the machines. 
They're starting to take over.

395
01:01:15,630 --> 01:01:19,092
My office, on this floor, 
we have to get there.

396
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:22,512
The access codes are in my safe.

397
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:45,386
- Why are they killing everyone? 
- To destroy any possible threat to Skynet.

398
01:02:44,677 --> 01:02:47,346
Which ones are the codes?

399
01:02:47,513 --> 01:02:49,348
Red envelope.

400
01:02:53,144 --> 01:02:56,981
Crystal Peak. You have 
to get to Crystal Peak.

401
01:02:57,148 --> 01:02:59,317
- What is he saying? 
- Crystal Peak.

402
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,153
A hardened facility 
in the Sierra Nevada mountains.

403
01:03:02,320 --> 01:03:06,115
Fifty-two miles northeast, 
bearing 0.5 degrees.

404
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,950
That's the system core?

405
01:03:08,534 --> 01:03:10,661
It's your only chance.

406
01:03:10,828 --> 01:03:15,792
You'll need a plane. The particle accelerator 
leads to the runway.

407
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,587
Take care of my daughter.

408
01:03:21,964 --> 01:03:25,384
Oh, Katie, I am sorry.

409
01:03:25,551 --> 01:03:28,846
I opened Pandora's box.

410
01:03:30,014 --> 01:03:31,015
Get down!

411
01:03:47,448 --> 01:03:49,825
There's nothing you can do. Come on.

412
01:03:49,992 --> 01:03:52,078
We must go. It is not safe here.

413
01:03:52,828 --> 01:03:55,289
Kate, we have to go.

414
01:03:55,498 --> 01:03:59,168
Kate! He wanted you to come with me.

415
01:03:59,418 --> 01:04:03,548
He wanted us to shut Skynet down. 
Come on.

416
01:04:05,341 --> 01:04:06,759
Come on.

417
01:04:18,729 --> 01:04:20,356
Run!

418
01:05:54,992 --> 01:05:56,577
Let's go.

419
01:07:07,982 --> 01:07:10,818
That's it. We can follow it 
out to the runway.

420
01:07:11,026 --> 01:07:12,737
Come on.

421
01:08:23,724 --> 01:08:26,185
Oh, God. She's coming.

422
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:31,607
What are you doing?

423
01:08:32,691 --> 01:08:33,734
Powering up.

424
01:08:38,906 --> 01:08:40,032
Come on.

425
01:09:50,644 --> 01:09:52,021
It's working.

426
01:09:59,612 --> 01:10:01,322
Come on.

427
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,317
There's my father's plane. 
I trained on it.

428
01:11:31,370 --> 01:11:33,580
Yes! He made it.

429
01:11:35,541 --> 01:11:37,543
Get away from me.

430
01:11:40,045 --> 01:11:41,046
Leave!

431
01:11:42,798 --> 01:11:43,924
Now!

432
01:11:44,383 --> 01:11:45,551
Let's go!

433
01:11:50,514 --> 01:11:53,600
- The master's on. Throttle's set. 
- Come on. Let's go.

434
01:11:59,606 --> 01:12:02,651
Oh, please. You can't do this.

435
01:12:02,818 --> 01:12:04,445
I have no choice.

436
01:12:05,362 --> 01:12:07,698
The T-X...

437
01:12:07,990 --> 01:12:10,367
...has corrupted my system.

438
01:12:14,038 --> 01:12:17,041
You can't kill a human being. 
You said so yourself.

439
01:12:17,207 --> 01:12:19,084
Let him go!

440
01:12:23,756 --> 01:12:25,549
You're fighting it right now.

441
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,510
My CPU is intact.

442
01:12:29,094 --> 01:12:32,890
But I cannot control my other functions.

443
01:12:33,057 --> 01:12:36,685
You don't have to do this. 
You don't want to do this!

444
01:12:37,186 --> 01:12:41,190
Desire is irrelevant.

445
01:12:41,398 --> 01:12:43,942
I am a machine.

446
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,211
What is your mission?

447
01:13:03,962 --> 01:13:07,508
To ensure the survival of John Connor...

448
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:09,718
...and Katherine Brewster.

449
01:13:15,057 --> 01:13:18,268
You are about to fail that mission!

450
01:13:25,150 --> 01:13:27,945
I can- I cannot.

451
01:13:29,029 --> 01:13:31,156
You know what you have to do.

452
01:13:33,117 --> 01:13:35,702
You know my destiny.

453
01:13:40,332 --> 01:13:41,500
I have to live.

454
01:14:22,207 --> 01:14:24,751
- Are you okay? 
- What happened?

455
01:14:24,918 --> 01:14:27,546
He couldn't do it. 
He shut himself down.

456
01:14:31,300 --> 01:14:33,886
- Can you fly? 
- Yeah.

457
01:15:01,288 --> 01:15:03,499
Okay. 015 degrees...

458
01:15:02,748 --> 01:15:07,878
...52 miles, our max air speed 
is about 160.

459
01:15:08,086 --> 01:15:10,464
We've got 32 minutes.

460
01:15:10,631 --> 01:15:12,466
It's just you and me now.

461
01:15:12,633 --> 01:15:15,093
What if we can't stop it?

462
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:19,348
There's enough C-4 here 
to take out 10 supercomputers.

463
01:15:19,765 --> 01:15:22,100
We're gonna make it, Kate.

464
01:15:23,310 --> 01:15:25,687
The future is up to us.

465
01:15:32,110 --> 01:15:34,363
That's gotta be it.

466
01:16:37,509 --> 01:16:40,596
Skynet. There may be more of them.

467
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,561
Come on.

468
01:17:01,783 --> 01:17:04,953
I think this is some kind of blast door.

469
01:17:08,081 --> 01:17:10,751
There's no way 
we can blow through this thing.

470
01:17:12,002 --> 01:17:13,003
John, look.

471
01:17:16,006 --> 01:17:17,424
Now what?

472
01:17:20,260 --> 01:17:22,596
It's a code prompt.

473
01:17:29,728 --> 01:17:32,773
Type in "Dakota 775."

474
01:17:37,027 --> 01:17:39,279
"Red 176."

475
01:18:00,300 --> 01:18:02,636
Come on! 
We gotta get this thing open.

476
01:18:02,886 --> 01:18:04,721
Here. It's "Avalon 412."

477
01:18:05,639 --> 01:18:06,973
Put it in!

478
01:18:41,341 --> 01:18:42,759
Come on!

479
01:18:58,358 --> 01:19:00,777
I'm back.

480
01:19:16,209 --> 01:19:18,378
Go! Now!

481
01:19:18,962 --> 01:19:19,963
Come on!

482
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,405
- Thank you. 
- We'll meet again.

483
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:46,823
Go!

484
01:19:47,991 --> 01:19:48,992
Come on!

485
01:20:31,993 --> 01:20:33,537
You are terminated.

486
01:21:04,150 --> 01:21:05,485
The elevator.

487
01:21:12,075 --> 01:21:14,494
I'll set the detonator for five minutes.

488
01:21:14,995 --> 01:21:17,414
That should give us enough time 
to get back up.

489
01:21:48,778 --> 01:21:50,530
What is this place?

490
01:22:31,237 --> 01:22:33,740
These computers are 30 years old.

491
01:22:42,248 --> 01:22:44,084
This isn't Skynet.

492
01:22:48,755 --> 01:22:50,590
There's nothing here.

493
01:22:55,762 --> 01:22:58,598
This is a fallout shelter for VIPs.

494
01:23:00,433 --> 01:23:02,769
Only they never got the warning.

495
01:23:17,075 --> 01:23:18,910
Why didn't he tell us?

496
01:23:22,247 --> 01:23:24,666
Why did he lead us down here?

497
01:23:30,422 --> 01:23:32,090
To live.

498
01:23:33,258 --> 01:23:35,260
That was his mission.

499
01:23:49,107 --> 01:23:50,358
There was never any stopping it.

500
01:23:54,946 --> 01:23:56,281
John...

501
01:23:57,615 --> 01:23:59,284
...we could just...

502
01:24:00,118 --> 01:24:01,453
...let it go.

503
01:24:04,289 --> 01:24:05,623
Hello?

504
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:08,626
Hello? Can somebody hear me?

505
01:24:09,711 --> 01:24:11,546
This is Montana Civil Defense.

506
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:15,300
Somebody please come in.

507
01:24:15,800 --> 01:24:17,469
Is there anybody there?

508
01:24:17,802 --> 01:24:20,805
Anyone reading me? Over.

509
01:24:21,973 --> 01:24:26,227
Rumors about a launch sequence. 
Command and control have broken down.

510
01:24:27,479 --> 01:24:30,565
Is anyone receiving me? 
Somebody?

511
01:24:32,650 --> 01:24:34,652
Somebody please come in.

512
01:24:35,070 --> 01:24:36,404
Anybody out there?

513
01:24:36,654 --> 01:24:39,991
- This is SAC Nellis. We're under attack. 
- CQ? CQ?

514
01:24:40,241 --> 01:24:41,826
Is anybody there?

515
01:24:43,828 --> 01:24:47,499
This is John Connor at Crystal Peak.

516
01:24:48,416 --> 01:24:53,171
Connor? What the hell is happening? 
Who's in charge there?

517
01:25:00,011 --> 01:25:01,346
I am.

518
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:05,016
Connor, can you help us?

519
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:10,188
This is Montana Civil Defense. 
Where did you say you were again?
