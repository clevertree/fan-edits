# Terminator 3 (2003) - Brass Monkey Edition

## Description
In Brass Monkey Edition, I attempt to cut out all distracting dialog and sequences in Terminator 3 to be more like the first two movies. Everything about T3 was lackluster compared to the prequels. I honestly think it all came down to bad editing as a result of in-fighting between the creators of T1/T2, otherwise I can't see why Mario Kassar failed so hard in T3. 

## Changes
Nick Stahl was removed as much as possible, along with - his crappy narration, the stripper scene, dialog about Kate worrying over her wedding, and many others distracting or contradictory scenes. For example, in this trailer sequence, I removed a shot with a sign that says 'cash only', meaning the telephone lines are down, but the clerk calls the police at the end of the movie - and the call goes through. 

I also replaced "Dat Funky Man" by some unknown guy being played in the background with Beastie Boys 'Brass Monkey', which really really REALLY seemed like the original song pick for this scene, likely decided back in the 90s when the T3 script was first realized. Clearly Terminator 3 is a victim of the 21st century. 

DM me for a copy of the whole movie.
