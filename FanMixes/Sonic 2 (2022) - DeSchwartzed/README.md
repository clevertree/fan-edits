## Description

The Sonic Movie Trilogy (2020-2024) is quite unwatchable
due to decisions by Ben Schwartz and other editors to add
distracting, unamusing, [racist](https://www.reddit.com/r/rant/comments/1j5d6a8/the_sonic_the_hedgehog_2_movie_is_racist/),
and otherwise agenda-driven dialog during post-production.
This project aims to restore the original vision of the live action Sonic Trilogy
before the project was sabotaged.

## Changes

All distracting or overly sappy dialogs were removed, while all plot points are retained.
The credit vocal songs (which had nothing to do with Sonic games or movies)
have been replaced with actual remixes of sonic game music.
I added four remixes to each movie from the corresponding Sonic game.
Sonic 3 2024 included remixes from both Sonic 3 game and Sonic and Knuckles.
Much [predictive programming](https://joyoffaith.com/predictive-programming.html) (PP) has been removed where it doesn't tie directly to the plot.

I do blame Ben Schwartz for nearly all the jokes he came up with. I don't think they were just 'bad' or 'annoying';
The decisions Schwartz and others made in all 3 movies during post-production also ruined the *continuity*.
In post, they should have cast a normal 'child voice' actor like they did with Tails who was voiced by Colleen O'Shaughnessey.
Aside from distracting dialog, he portrayed the main character as a sarcastic adult rather than an orphaned child from another planet.
I'll remind everyone that Sonic was a child in the first movie, and that none of his commentary should be 'Family guy' style pop references.
It should be something a child says.
Moreover, Sonic shouldn't behave as if someone is laughing at his jokes all day if he literally had zero friends on Earth.
This isn't the only movie I blame someone for ruining in Post Production.
In my edit of Final Fantasy the Spirits Within, I make that case as well.

### Removals

Much of the Sonic sardonic commentary dialogue (voiced by Ben Schwartz) has been removed.
Some dialog of Knuckles, Tales, has been removed.
Nearly all dialogue and scenes with Wade and Rachel were removed.
Many sappy family scenes were removed.

### Predictive Programming

Most people don't know what PP is, and some who do think they cannot fall for it.
Sometimes it's subtle, like in this movie where Rachel is constantly telling Maddie to divorce Tom, right from the first scene, and with absolutely no reason or context.
If anyone can please point me to a single scene in all 3 movies where Tom legitimately did something to upset Rachel,
and I'll re-add those scenes, but if otherwise they remain removed.
