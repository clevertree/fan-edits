1
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:07,585
Every night, the same dream, 
the same strange planet.

2
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,420
But why?

3
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,173
What are they trying to tell me?

4
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,349
It's been 34 years 
since they arrived on this planet.

5
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,349
It's been 34 years 
since they arrived on this planet.

6
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,018
And not a day passes 
that the survivors...

7
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:28,064
...forced to live in barrier cities, 
do not live in fear.

8
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,400
I have vowed to end that fear.

9
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,111
I believe my dreams hold the key.

10
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,866
The question is, will I be 
in time to save the Earth?

11
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,270
Where are you?

12
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,751
This is a restricted area.

13
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,628
Do not move!

14
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,215
- What's she doing here captain? 
- I don't know, but we're getting her out.

15
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,302
- You're coming with us. 
- Behind you!

16
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,430
Hold it right there!

17
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,724
Damn it. Let's move, people!

18
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,815
Two coming through the wall!

19
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,736
Hold your fire. 
Those tanks are flammable!

20
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,657
Ryan, Neil, let's go!

21
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,888
Captain, the transport is not going 
to wait for us much longer.

22
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,058
- I understand that. 
- It's in bad shape.

23
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,976
I need a minute to extract it.

24
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,312
Miss. That's a minute we do not have.

25
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,856
I'm afraid he's right about that ma'am.

26
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,068
Phantoms! We have incoming.

27
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,624
Everyone, up top!

28
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,210
Go, go, go!

29
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,509
- Transport, requesting immediate evac. 
- Affirmative.

30
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,303
Up here!

31
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,854
- Captain! - They're right 
behind you! - Captain, come on!

32
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,151
I've got you!

33
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,196
- You okay? 
- Yeah.

34
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,949
All right, everybody, here they come.

35
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,987
You okay?

36
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,673
- Welcome back, captain. 
- We're clean.

37
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,091
- Let's make sure of that shall we?

38
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,133
Yes, sir.

39
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,593
- Yes, sir. 
- Yes, sir.

40
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,648
Okay, next.

41
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,071
You know, my security rating 
allows me to bypass this.

42
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,281
Not today it doesn't.

43
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,992
Something's not right.

44
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,204
- About this mission? Or that woman? 
- Both.

45
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,497
Next.

46
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,380
Oh shit!

47
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,673
- Captain! 
- They got him.

48
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,466
There must be a mistake.

49
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,634
You came in contact with a Phantom sir. 
Please remain calm.

50
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,930
Administering treatment shield.

51
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,058
- What level is he? 
- Blue. It will be code red in 3-1/2 minutes.

52
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,229
We have to treat him. Now!

53
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,648
I'm sorry, but that's impossible. 
We'll transfer him to the treatment center.

54
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,733
There's no time for that.

55
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,073
Get him to the table.

56
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,200
Hang in there, captain.

57
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,007
Locating pathogens.

58
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,224
Jesus, look at that thing!

59
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,310
- How much more time? 
- Not enough.

60
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,686
When he reaches code red,

61
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,190
the treatment shield won't be 
able to hold the alien particles.

62
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,817
Engaging bio-etheric laser.

63
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,088
We've lost contact. 
Infestation is moving deeper.

64
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,175
His treatment shield is failing.

65
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,968
Found it.

66
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,979
Come on.

67
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,307
It's all right.

68
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,980
Don't worry. 
You'll be back to normal in no time.

69
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,901
Uh.. Doctor, we need 
to scan you for infestation.

70
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,863
That won't be necessary. 
I'll take responsibility.

71
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,618
Hey, doc.

72
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,371
Thanks for saving him.

73
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,681
It's a match. We've found it.

74
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,016
Yes.

75
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,268
The sixth spirit.

76
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,854
It seemed today you broke 
nearly every protocol.

77
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,857
How long do you think this would 
have survived outside the barrier?

78
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,443
Aki, you know there are 
elements in the council and

79
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,862
military just waiting for 
an excuse to shut us down.

80
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,671
If we attack the meteor with this, we will 
eliminate the Phantoms at their source.

81
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,631
General Hein, calm down.

82
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,841
At our last meeting, We voted 6 to 2...

83
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,512
...to postpone using the Zeus cannon 
to attack the Leonid Meteor.

84
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,015
We have re-convened today to vote 
on that very issue again.

85
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,645
Now, I'd like to ask the director 
of the Bio-Etheric Center to speak.

86
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,231
- Dr. Sid, please. 
- Thank you.

87
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,527
As you all know, the Phantoms' nest 
is in the Leonid Meteor...

88
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,238
...that landed here 34 years ago.

89
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:34,201
What you see now are the records 
of every assault on the meteor to date.

90
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,205
Physical attacks have had 
utterly no effect.

91
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:42,418
This scene took place three months ago 
during a full-scale bombardment.

92
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,755
Now please note the Phantoms outside 
the meteor are indeed destroyed.

93
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,843
However, inside, many that 
were dormant come to life...

94
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,431
...and as you see, 
overall Phantom density remains the same.

95
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,392
The newly risen aliens 
respond to the attack...

96
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,353
...by burrowing even 
deeper into the Earth.

97
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,231
Now, this is very interesting to me Dr. Sid...

98
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,526
...because we see 
the same thing during surgery...

99
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:12,239
...when using bio-etheric lasers 
on Phantom particles, do we not?

100
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,949
Yes, indeed we do.

101
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,702
You see. the injured particles escape...

102
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,080
...burying or digging themselves deeper 
into a patient's body.

103
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,210
And when we increase the laser power 
to destroy these deeper particles...

104
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,548
...we have had incidents resulting in 
further injury to a patient...

105
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,592
...and in some cases...

106
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,926
...death.

107
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,220
And what exactly does that mean doctor?

108
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,890
It means there's a very good chance...

109
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,351
...the beam from the Zeus cannon 
will burn the Phantoms in the meteor.

110
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,728
Exactly! Thank you.

111
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:47,608
However, it also means that 
the beam energy may be too strong...

112
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,276
...injuring the Earth.

113
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,487
Injure the Earth?

114
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,781
You mean the Gaia.

115
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,950
- I mean... 
- You mean the spirit of the Earth.

116
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,289
Yes, the spirit of the Earth.

117
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,792
Did he say what I think he said?

118
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,126
What are you doing?

119
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,254
I know what I'm doing and 
whatever you do, keep your mouth shut.

120
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,672
This is ridiculous.

121
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,633
Dr. Sid, the Gaia theory 
has not been proven.

122
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:17,679
Even if Gaia does exist, won't we 
still have to remove the Phantoms?

123
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,100
I think if there's any chance of success, 
we should take it.

124
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,435
- Don't you agree? 
- Well, of course i do.

125
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,105
But there is an alternative 
to the space cannon.

126
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,439
Another method?

127
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,110
- Yes. A means of disabling the Phantoms. 
- Please.

128
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,448
As we know, the aliens display 
a distinct energy pattern.

129
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,828
Now, it is a fact that 
two opposing bio-etheric waves...

130
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,580
...placed one over the other 
will cancel each other out.

131
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,084
It is theoretically possible 
to construct a wave pattern...

132
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,419
...in direct opposition 
to the Phantom energy.

133
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,798
We are currently assembling such 
a wave and are nearing completion.

134
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,633
Members of the council...

135
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,011
...gathering plants and animals...

136
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,640
...from around the world to fight 
the Phantoms is utter nonsense.

137
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,811
The Zeus cannon is a proven, 
effective weapon.

138
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,730
It will kill Phantoms.

139
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,942
Can we afford to wait 
for some crazy invention...

140
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,446
...some army of 
touchy-feely plants and animals...

141
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,658
...An invention that offers no solid evidence 
that it will destroy the aliens?

142
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,034
There is evidence!

143
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,537
Our partially completed energy wave...

144
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,331
...has successfully stopped 
Phantom particles from spreading...

145
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,042
...through a terminally-infected patient.

146
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,421
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence 
that a terminal patient has been cured?

147
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,799
Not cured. The wave is not complete.

148
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,512
But we've succeeded in containing the 
particles safely inside the patient.

149
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,447
You may have bought us some time Aki, 
but i wonder at what cost?

150
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,992
Doctor, I can't keep hiding 
in the background while you protect me.

151
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,204
I want what life I have left 
to mean something.

152
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,832
Will you listen to me? When we find 
the seventh and eighth spirits...

153
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,002
If we find them. 
What we need now is some luck.

154
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,088
Luck has nothing to do with it.

155
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,674
Faith and hard work, girl...

156
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,428
...coz I'll be damned if 
you're going to die before me.

157
00:21:15,857 --> 00:21:17,150
Captain Edwards...

158
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:22,155
...you extracted a Dr. Ross from 
Old New York several days ago did you not?

159
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:25,659
- Yes, sir. 
- What were your impressions of Dr. Ross?

160
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:29,329
She seemed very capable and determined, sir.

161
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,958
You and the Deep Eyes are being 
temporarily reassigned.

162
00:21:33,917 --> 00:21:36,378
You will guard Dr. Ross 
when she reenters the wasteland.

163
00:21:37,295 --> 00:21:40,674
- Understood, sir. 
- You don't understand yet, captain.

164
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:45,220
Report any aberrant behavior 
in Dr. Ross to the major immediately.

165
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,680
Aberrant behavior sir?

166
00:21:46,888 --> 00:21:52,060
The woman carries an alien infestation, captain. 
We don't know what it may be doing to her.

167
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:54,688
The alien presence could be affecting her judgment.

168
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,899
They may be manipulating the doctor 
for their very own purposes.

169
00:21:58,150 --> 00:22:00,986
She's had prolonged exposure 
to Phantom tissue.

170
00:22:01,278 --> 00:22:03,905
If this begins to manifest itself in any way...

171
00:22:04,114 --> 00:22:08,910
...Dr. Ross is to be placed under arrest 
and transported here for observation.

172
00:22:10,287 --> 00:22:13,373
It is, in fact, for her own good, captain.

173
00:22:13,623 --> 00:22:14,708
Of course, sir.

174
00:23:54,182 --> 00:23:57,853
I'm convinced that these dreams 
are some form of communication.

175
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:00,063
Their message still eludes me...

176
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:04,734
...but they're coming faster now 
and that can only mean one thing.

177
00:24:05,193 --> 00:24:08,155
The Phantoms inside me are beginning to win.

178
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:11,491
Our target is 50 klicks west of Tucson.

179
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,243
- Roger. 
- Phantom concentration?

180
00:24:13,452 --> 00:24:15,871
Not good. We've got big metas everywhere.

181
00:24:15,162 --> 00:24:17,914
So it's gonna be a real picnic.

182
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:21,918
Stick close to me. No heroics today. Okay? 
Everything by the book.

183
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:23,962
By the book. Right.

184
00:24:30,552 --> 00:24:34,055
If we drop energy buoys here, 
here and here...

185
00:24:34,306 --> 00:24:36,099
...we should be able to 
land, acquire the target,

186
00:24:36,099 --> 00:24:38,143
and get out before the Phantoms 
even know we were there.

187
00:24:38,351 --> 00:24:40,437
And the buoys will attract the Phantoms?

188
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,606
- Yeah. 
- For a while.

189
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:55,285
So you're from the 307th's right? 
Under General Hein?

190
00:24:55,494 --> 00:24:59,623
Ever done wasteland recon before? 
It can get pretty ugly.

191
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:31,613
Captain, rendezvous for evac at 
vector 6, coordinate 279.

192
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,283
Roger that. Stay alert for hostiles.

193
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:55,804
Looks like they've taken the bait.

194
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:14,531
The seventh spirit should be 
just beyond that line of wreckage.

195
00:26:14,739 --> 00:26:17,617
I don't see how any living thing 
could survive out here?

196
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,160
We'll find out soon enough.

197
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,582
This was the Phantom Cleansing Mission.

198
00:26:24,833 --> 00:26:27,335
It was supposed to end the war.

199
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,507
My father's in here somewhere.

200
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,636
All right.

201
00:26:37,304 --> 00:26:39,097
Let's move out, people.

202
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,531
I'll be damned.

203
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:57,824
A survivor.

204
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:00,619
What's it doing out here?

205
00:27:00,827 --> 00:27:02,704
Hoping for life to return.

206
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,915
Is that our spirit, doc?

207
00:27:07,876 --> 00:27:08,918
No.

208
00:27:23,099 --> 00:27:24,809
We're closing in on the life form.

209
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:28,980
- Distance? 
- Hard to say. We're very close.

210
00:27:28,563 --> 00:27:31,524
I don't see anything.

211
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,450
- You're not gonna tell me it's him? 
- That's impossible.

212
00:27:48,833 --> 00:27:50,627
It's not the soldier. It's his ovo-pac.

213
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:54,756
How do you explain that? The pacs power 
our weapons, the barrier cities...

214
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:56,716
I mean it's just bio-etheric energy.

215
00:27:56,925 --> 00:28:00,345
And to create that energy we use 
living tissue. Single-cell organisms.

216
00:28:00,553 --> 00:28:03,348
- You're telling me his backpack is the seventh spirit? 
- Yes.

217
00:28:03,556 --> 00:28:05,433
We have incoming. Captain? Do you read me?

218
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:06,726
- Captain? 
- What? Say again?

219
00:28:07,018 --> 00:28:08,853
You read me captain? We have incoming.

220
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,980
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.

221
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:30,708
I need a hand! Sarge!

222
00:28:34,921 --> 00:28:38,007
- Those buoys? They're not working. 
- Yeah.

223
00:28:40,927 --> 00:28:43,722
- Are you all right? 
- Of course I am.

224
00:28:43,972 --> 00:28:45,682
Let's get the hell out of here!

225
00:28:49,352 --> 00:28:51,396
Something's not right. 
This shouldn't be happening.

226
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:53,898
Something's attracting them.

227
00:28:54,899 --> 00:28:55,984
Aki!

228
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:04,367
- They're right on us, sir. Closing in fast! 
- Jane, take the lead.

229
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,383
Fire in the hole!

230
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:34,814
Get us out of here, Neil.

231
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:37,484
- Sir, I would love to, but... 
- Just do it!

232
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,761
- Sir? 
- It's okay, that's it.

233
00:30:06,429 --> 00:30:08,139
That doesn't look good, captain.

234
00:30:08,806 --> 00:30:10,600
We have to get her to a hospital.

235
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:14,395
- You have your orders, sir. 
- What the hell is going on here?

236
00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:18,358
Dr. Ross is to be taken into custody now, sir.

237
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,614
Lower your weapons. That's an order!

238
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:26,824
Sir. We have no choice, 
but to relieve you of your command.

239
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,536
I won't let you do this soldier. 
You'll gonna have to shoot me.

240
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,371
Stand down, captain!

241
00:31:55,246 --> 00:31:57,332
Hang on, everyone!

242
00:32:02,045 --> 00:32:06,132
That's enough. 
Hands where I can see them. Everyone now!

243
00:32:16,851 --> 00:32:18,394
Deep Eyes, hard to starboard!

244
00:32:39,499 --> 00:32:42,502
The Deep Eyes are returning 
from the wasteland, sir.

245
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,295
Apparently, there was an incident.

246
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:47,382
It would seem the Phantoms 
were attracted to Dr. Ross.

247
00:32:47,632 --> 00:32:50,843
The crew barely escaped with their lives.

248
00:32:51,052 --> 00:32:53,554
And sir, Captain Edwards is still in command.

249
00:32:53,763 --> 00:32:55,264
Issue an order.

250
00:32:55,473 --> 00:32:58,434
I want Edwards and Dr. Ross 
placed under arrest.

251
00:32:58,643 --> 00:33:01,938
All research materials pertaining 
to Dr. Sid's wave theory...

252
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,773
...are to be confiscated immediately.

253
00:33:03,982 --> 00:33:06,901
That might not go over 
too well with the council, sir.

254
00:33:07,110 --> 00:33:09,529
What a tragedy that would be.

255
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:14,033
This is perfect, major. 
The good captain has opened the door for us.

256
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,245
By tomorrow morning, 
the council will be at our feet...

257
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:20,873
...thanking us for exposing 
the traitors and imploring us...

258
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:23,209
...to save them from the Phantoms.

259
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,465
How is she, doctor?

260
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,720
- She is dying. 
- There must be something you can do.

261
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,305
Aki is fighting with 
only six of the eight spirits.

262
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:38,725
We'll have to implant the seventh 
directly into her chest plate.

263
00:33:39,809 --> 00:33:42,270
It took a bullet. 
I think it might be damaged.

264
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,647
We have to repair this panel quickly.

265
00:33:45,732 --> 00:33:50,403
Her vital signs are dropping. 
Aki is slipping away from us.

266
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:55,658
She needs a sympathetic spirit 
to help hold her in this world.

267
00:33:55,867 --> 00:34:00,538
And I can think of no spirit better suited 
for that task than yours, captain.

268
00:34:00,788 --> 00:34:04,500
- I don't understand. 
- You don't have to understand.

269
00:34:04,959 --> 00:34:06,919
You just be with her now.

270
00:34:08,045 --> 00:34:10,131
You keep her here with us.

271
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:04,560
Aki? Where are we?

272
00:35:04,769 --> 00:35:06,646
On an alien planet.

273
00:35:06,854 --> 00:35:08,481
How is that possible?

274
00:35:10,107 --> 00:35:12,276
I'm not entirely sure.

275
00:35:12,485 --> 00:35:13,986
You seem pretty calm.

276
00:35:14,195 --> 00:35:17,448
I've been having this dream 
every night for months.

277
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:18,699
Dream?

278
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:21,410
Well, whatever it is.

279
00:35:23,329 --> 00:35:25,832
You're really here, aren't you?

280
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,001
What's happening to me?

281
00:35:29,293 --> 00:35:34,048
Dr. Sid is implanting the seventh spirit 
directly into your body.

282
00:35:37,468 --> 00:35:39,971
Something you should see here, sir.

283
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:49,939
And I am watching what, major?

284
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:53,609
It seems Dr. Ross has been recording her dreams.

285
00:35:53,818 --> 00:35:56,404
And why would I be interested in...

286
00:35:57,822 --> 00:35:59,073
...her dreams?

287
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:01,742
This is it. This is our evidence.

288
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:04,412
She's under the influence of the Phantoms.

289
00:36:07,165 --> 00:36:11,669
Dr. Ross' dreams should be all the council needs 
to authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.

290
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:15,256
The council is content to hide 
powering inside this barrier...

291
00:36:15,464 --> 00:36:18,009
...while the world dies a little more every day.

292
00:36:18,217 --> 00:36:21,012
I believe they need a push 
in the right direction, major.

293
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:23,973
Get together a group of your most trusted men.

294
00:37:15,816 --> 00:37:17,944
What are they doing. 
Why are they staring at us?

295
00:37:18,152 --> 00:37:19,695
Not at us.

296
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,248
Welcome back, captain.

297
00:38:15,001 --> 00:38:16,210
Is it over?

298
00:38:17,128 --> 00:38:18,796
How is she, doctor?

299
00:38:19,005 --> 00:38:21,215
She's gonna be fine. 
But this is only temporary.

300
00:38:21,465 --> 00:38:25,011
We'll need to find the eighth 
and final spirit to cure her.

301
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:30,641
Aki, can you hear me?

302
00:38:32,977 --> 00:38:34,603
I finished it.

303
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,647
I know what it means.

304
00:38:36,856 --> 00:38:39,608
I know what the Phantoms really are.

305
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:44,113
Nobody move! You're all under arrest!

306
00:38:55,041 --> 00:38:56,459
We have them, sir.

307
00:38:57,752 --> 00:38:58,836
Sir?

308
00:38:59,378 --> 00:39:01,589
My wife and daughter...

309
00:39:03,758 --> 00:39:08,429
...were killed by Phantoms in the 
San Francisco Barrier City was attacked.

310
00:39:08,637 --> 00:39:10,598
Did I ever tell you that?

311
00:39:15,061 --> 00:39:17,229
You've lost family, haven't you?

312
00:39:17,688 --> 00:39:18,898
Yes, sir.

313
00:39:19,398 --> 00:39:21,400
That's why I trust you.

314
00:39:22,985 --> 00:39:25,696
You know what must be done.

315
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:35,373
Security override.

316
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,334
Perimeter breached.

317
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:42,171
Major, arrest these men.

318
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:45,758
- Take it easy. 
- Stand up. Go.

319
00:39:45,966 --> 00:39:49,720
You are relieved of your post. 
Don't ask any questions.

320
00:39:51,597 --> 00:39:53,349
Reduce power to Sector 31.

321
00:39:53,557 --> 00:39:55,559
Sir, you do realize that the Phantoms...

322
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:57,186
What I realize, major...

323
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,357
...is that we must force the council 
to take action against the enemy.

324
00:40:07,822 --> 00:40:11,075
25% of energy pipe alpha redirected.

325
00:40:11,867 --> 00:40:14,787
Lowering power output to Sector 31.

326
00:40:15,913 --> 00:40:19,041
Barrier breached in Sector 31, general. 
They're coming through now.

327
00:40:19,208 --> 00:40:22,419
Oh I think we can easily handle 
a few Phantoms in a contained space.

328
00:40:23,379 --> 00:40:28,300
Relax, major. When this night's over, 
you're going to be a hero.

329
00:40:30,094 --> 00:40:33,889
Alright. Why do you think 
we've never been able to determine...

330
00:40:34,098 --> 00:40:38,269
...a relationship between the human-sized Phantoms 
and the giant ones roaming the wastelands?

331
00:40:38,561 --> 00:40:41,480
He's right. If you've spent as much time 
in the field as we had...

332
00:40:41,689 --> 00:40:45,192
...you know there is no relationship. 
It's like a zoo out there.

333
00:40:45,401 --> 00:40:49,071
Precisely. I think the giant ones are 
like our whales or elephants.

334
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:53,576
But why would an invading army bring 
a bunch of whales and elephants along for the ride?

335
00:40:53,826 --> 00:40:56,579
Unless their ship was kind of 
a crazy Noah's Ark?

336
00:40:57,163 --> 00:40:59,540
We have always assumed that the meteor...

337
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,960
...was intended as a form of transportation. 
Perhaps it wasn't.

338
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,464
The meteor is a chunk of their planet 
that got thrown into space...

339
00:41:06,672 --> 00:41:07,840
...when they destroyed their world.

340
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:12,553
But how could they survive the trip 
across outer space on a hunk of rock?

341
00:41:12,761 --> 00:41:14,263
They didn't.

342
00:41:18,475 --> 00:41:22,146
I think that explains why we never had a chance.

343
00:41:22,438 --> 00:41:25,941
All our strategies are based on one assumption:

344
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:29,153
That we were fighting alien invaders.

345
00:41:29,361 --> 00:41:32,198
Think of the dream, Gray. How they died.

346
00:41:32,406 --> 00:41:35,242
Since then, all they've known is suffering.

347
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,328
They're not an invading army.

348
00:41:37,536 --> 00:41:39,246
They're ghosts.

349
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:42,333
How many Phantoms?

350
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,376
More than enough to convince the council, sir.

351
00:41:44,627 --> 00:41:48,005
Excellent. Sound an alert. Send 
a squad out to eliminate them.

352
00:41:48,005 --> 00:41:48,923
Yes sir.

353
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,717
Alert status. Full deployment.

354
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:53,677
Sir. I have numerous Phantom contacts!

355
00:41:53,928 --> 00:41:55,387
Well, of course you do.

356
00:41:55,596 --> 00:41:58,432
Outside of Sector 31, sir. 
And moving at incredible speed.

357
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:00,434
Major, What the hell is going on here?

358
00:42:00,643 --> 00:42:02,019
They're in the pipes.

359
00:42:02,228 --> 00:42:04,772
They're moving with the bio-etheric energy flow.

360
00:42:05,022 --> 00:42:08,901
That's impossible. No living thing 
could survive in those pipes.

361
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:13,447
Well, we've got a big one heading this way. 
Meta class, sir.

362
00:42:20,829 --> 00:42:22,206
Oh, my God.

363
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:24,208
Hold your fire!

364
00:43:10,921 --> 00:43:12,548
What have I done?

365
00:43:59,928 --> 00:44:02,556
- Here they come. 
- But the others! Dr. Sid!

366
00:44:02,765 --> 00:44:05,059
Deep Eyes'll take care of him. 
Come on.

367
00:44:12,524 --> 00:44:14,651
What's happening. Why can we see them now?

368
00:44:14,902 --> 00:44:18,238
They must be carrying a residual charge 
from passing through the barrier.

369
00:44:23,160 --> 00:44:24,453
Behind you!

370
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,142
All aboard, captain!

371
00:46:36,001 --> 00:46:37,044
We need to find my ship.

372
00:46:37,252 --> 00:46:39,922
If it was towed inside the city, 
it would be in the military hangar.

373
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:41,882
That's a big "if. "

374
00:46:50,849 --> 00:46:52,059
Look out!

375
00:46:59,983 --> 00:47:02,069
- Get us onto the platform. 
- You got it.

376
00:47:17,793 --> 00:47:18,877
Hang on, everybody!

377
00:47:38,188 --> 00:47:38,814
- Captain.

378
00:47:44,111 --> 00:47:46,572
Oh, God. Talk to me, sarge.

379
00:47:47,072 --> 00:47:48,115
Ouch!

380
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,658
- Give me a hand, Jane. 
- Right.

381
00:47:49,866 --> 00:47:53,954
No wait! We're risking further injury. 
We need the proper tools to cut him out.

382
00:47:54,162 --> 00:47:55,455
They're in my ship.

383
00:47:56,874 --> 00:48:00,335
- No. No, doc. No drugs. 
- Captain?

384
00:48:00,544 --> 00:48:01,795
You heard the man.

385
00:48:02,504 --> 00:48:04,089
We'll find the ship and be back for you.

386
00:48:04,339 --> 00:48:06,091
- I'll stay with him. 
- Me too.

387
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:07,884
Nobody's staying.

388
00:48:09,094 --> 00:48:11,013
- Just give me a gun. 
- You got it.

389
00:48:11,221 --> 00:48:13,765
Give him a weapon. Do it!

390
00:48:16,268 --> 00:48:18,061
We'll be back for you, sergeant.

391
00:48:18,395 --> 00:48:19,479
You hear me?

392
00:48:19,771 --> 00:48:22,983
I hear you, captain. 
Now, get out of here.

393
00:48:23,483 --> 00:48:24,818
Let's move out.

394
00:49:15,827 --> 00:49:18,163
A quad-axle ATV. This is good.

395
00:49:18,413 --> 00:49:22,459
It can be used to retrieve Ryan 
and transport him safely here.

396
00:49:22,668 --> 00:49:25,837
However, we'll need to replace 
these spent fuel cells.

397
00:49:26,129 --> 00:49:28,548
There could be some live ovo-pacs in the hangar.

398
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:41,353
Gray, be careful.

399
00:49:41,561 --> 00:49:42,771
You too.

400
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:26,314
Oh, yeah.

401
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,498
Neil, do you read me?

402
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:45,250
Loud and clear, captain.

403
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,294
This baby'll fly itself.

404
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:56,178
Flight path is set.

405
00:50:56,386 --> 00:50:57,846
Beginning rotation.

406
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,602
Stop the airtray. We have a problem.

407
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,396
I'm reading an impound tractor 
attached probably to the ship.

408
00:51:20,243 --> 00:51:21,745
There's the problem.

409
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:33,173
The controls are locked, naturally.

410
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,356
What's happening down there?

411
00:51:49,606 --> 00:51:52,109
Nothing we can't handle.

412
00:52:04,037 --> 00:52:07,124
- Neil, what's your status? 
- Almost there.

413
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,000
I want you two back inside.

414
00:52:09,209 --> 00:52:12,963
We're fine, sir. Jane is negotiating 
with extreme prejudice.

415
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:14,422
Talk to me, Jane.

416
00:52:16,007 --> 00:52:18,093
No problem here, captain.

417
00:52:23,598 --> 00:52:26,226
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.

418
00:53:06,308 --> 00:53:08,018
Jane, get out of there.

419
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,479
Get out of there now! Go! Jane!

420
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,648
Get the hell out of there!

421
00:54:01,404 --> 00:54:03,615
Over here, you son of a bitch!

422
00:56:08,573 --> 00:56:10,658
Gray, come on!

423
00:59:12,382 --> 00:59:14,259
I enlarged the scanning perimeter...

424
00:59:14,467 --> 00:59:17,262
...to include an area that 
we had previously overlooked.

425
00:59:17,470 --> 00:59:19,264
The impact crater.

426
00:59:20,306 --> 00:59:22,350
That's a strange place to find the eighth spirit.

427
00:59:22,558 --> 00:59:24,185
Yes, really quite astonishing.

428
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,729
But nothing could survive in there except Phantoms.

429
00:59:26,938 --> 00:59:28,064
Precisely.

430
00:59:28,398 --> 00:59:31,567
Which suggests that 
the eighth spirit is a Phantom spirit.

431
00:59:31,776 --> 00:59:34,988
I can't explain it at the moment, 
but once we get down there...

432
00:59:35,196 --> 00:59:38,491
- ... you will understand... 
- Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.

433
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,786
Yes, I expected that's how 
you would evaluate our chances.

434
00:59:42,036 --> 00:59:43,454
Well, am I wrong?

435
00:59:43,663 --> 00:59:44,080
No, I agree. We probably...

436
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:48,459
...won't live long enough to extract 
the eighth spirit from the crater.

437
00:59:48,668 --> 00:59:49,335
Then why should we even try it?

438
00:59:50,461 --> 00:59:52,547
Because we don't need to extract the eighth spirit.

439
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:54,549
If we can't bring the final spirit here...

440
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,302
...we can go there and complete 
the wave inside the crater.

441
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,928
Yes, exactly.

442
00:59:59,137 --> 01:00:01,097
And how do we do that, exactly?

443
01:00:01,514 --> 01:00:03,391
I can construct a device that...

444
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:07,895
...would attach to Aki's chest plate 
to gather the eighth spirit and then...

445
01:00:09,063 --> 01:00:10,189
And then what?

446
01:00:10,523 --> 01:00:13,693
And then we wait 
and see what happens.

447
01:00:43,931 --> 01:00:46,642
What caused the barrier 
to fail, General Hein?

448
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:50,271
I'm afraid it was 
only a matter of time...

449
01:00:50,480 --> 01:00:53,691
...before the Phantoms developed 
an immunity to our barriers.

450
01:00:54,108 --> 01:00:56,569
But I am relieved to see that you 
and the rest of the council...

451
01:00:56,778 --> 01:01:00,281
...were able to evacuate to Houston without incident.

452
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,201
It was a terrible loss suffered this evening.

453
01:01:03,409 --> 01:01:06,454
The council has reconsidered 
your proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.

454
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:07,872
I see.

455
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,458
We are transmitting the access codes to you now.

456
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:13,753
And, general...

457
01:01:15,171 --> 01:01:17,340
...best of luck to us all.

458
01:01:20,343 --> 01:01:21,844
Prepare to fire the cannon.

459
01:01:22,095 --> 01:01:23,179
The target, sir?

460
01:01:24,889 --> 01:01:26,682
The Phantom crater.

461
01:01:53,334 --> 01:01:57,672
Preparing to drop in three, two, one.

462
01:02:02,218 --> 01:02:03,928
Powering the shield.

463
01:02:06,889 --> 01:02:08,683
Okay, we're over the meteor.

464
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:10,393
Do you have it in sight, doctor?

465
01:02:11,394 --> 01:02:13,938
There are so many of them.

466
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:16,899
Wait.

467
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:21,237
Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit 
moving along the crater's surface.

468
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:24,949
All right. Now let's take a closer look.

469
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,866
Ready to fire in three minutes.

470
01:03:07,074 --> 01:03:10,870
Ovo-pacs at maximum. 
Transferring plasma flow to auto.

471
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:13,372
Counter-thrusters are engaged.

472
01:03:13,581 --> 01:03:16,417
Lox flow de-coupled. Status is green.

473
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:20,421
We have something on radar 
over the impact site, sir.

474
01:03:22,590 --> 01:03:23,925
It's her.

475
01:03:24,175 --> 01:03:25,301
Sir?

476
01:03:25,510 --> 01:03:28,012
Just a traitor under 
the influence of the enemy.

477
01:03:28,221 --> 01:03:29,972
Continue the countdown.

478
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:33,184
We'll take them all out at the same time.

479
01:03:36,562 --> 01:03:40,566
We're closing on the Phantom. 
Contact in 30 seconds.

480
01:03:41,901 --> 01:03:43,319
Target locked.

481
01:03:43,569 --> 01:03:46,239
Ready to fire on your command.

482
01:03:50,034 --> 01:03:52,662
It's a match! It's a perfect match!

483
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,664
- Target scanners ready, sir. 
- Fire.

484
01:04:29,615 --> 01:04:30,783
What was that?

485
01:04:31,033 --> 01:04:33,494
It's the Zeus. They're firing on the crater.

486
01:04:33,744 --> 01:04:37,164
- Aki, Captain, are you all right? 
- A little shaken. Stand by.

487
01:04:37,415 --> 01:04:41,919
Sid, the eighth spirit is not 
on our scanner. Do you have it?

488
01:04:42,503 --> 01:04:44,171
The eighth spirit...

489
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:46,632
...has been destroyed.

490
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:51,137
- What are we going to do now? 
- Nothing. This mission is over.

491
01:04:51,470 --> 01:04:53,264
- We have to get out of here. 
- Incoming!

492
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,839
What is that?

493
01:05:27,048 --> 01:05:30,384
If you're getting us out of here, 
you better do it now.

494
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:43,356
Hold on!

495
01:05:52,698 --> 01:05:54,659
I can't hold on to you.

496
01:05:59,288 --> 01:06:01,791
Unable to maintain altitude.

497
01:06:08,923 --> 01:06:11,425
Initiate emergency landing procedures.

498
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,702
Come in. Come in, please.

499
01:06:37,952 --> 01:06:40,788
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?

500
01:06:41,038 --> 01:06:44,959
Sid, I need to talk to the station. 
Can you patch us through?

501
01:06:47,461 --> 01:06:50,381
- What is that thing? 
- I don't know, sir.

502
01:06:50,631 --> 01:06:52,842
Incoming message, sir.

503
01:06:53,092 --> 01:06:55,553
General Hein, 
You must cease fire immediately.

504
01:06:55,845 --> 01:07:00,141
What you are looking at in the crater is the 
living spirit of an alien's home world.

505
01:07:00,349 --> 01:07:02,935
Their planet was destroyed 
and part of it landed here.

506
01:07:03,185 --> 01:07:05,771
This is not an invasion. It never was.

507
01:07:05,146 --> 01:07:10,401
I see and what have we been fighting 
all this time, doctor? Ghosts?

508
01:07:10,651 --> 01:07:15,239
Yes. Spirits that are confused, 
lost and angry.

509
01:07:15,489 --> 01:07:18,159
Right. And these spirits are 
coming out of this Gaia thing.

510
01:07:18,409 --> 01:07:19,994
General Hein, you have to listen.

511
01:07:20,286 --> 01:07:23,789
Alien Gaia, Earth Gaia. 
Doctor, even if I believed in such nonsense...

512
01:07:24,123 --> 01:07:26,876
...the fact remains the Earth 
is under attack from an aggressor...

513
01:07:27,084 --> 01:07:29,378
...who must be destroyed at all costs.

514
01:07:29,670 --> 01:07:32,131
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.

515
01:07:32,465 --> 01:07:35,217
Firing on the alien Gaia will only make it stronger.

516
01:07:35,509 --> 01:07:39,805
Well, since you're under the alien's influence, doctor, 
I will take your protest to mean that we are...

517
01:07:40,055 --> 01:07:41,974
...in fact pursuing the correct course of actions.

518
01:07:42,183 --> 01:07:46,687
So i suggest you take your last few moments 
and prepare to meet your Gaia.

519
01:07:46,812 --> 01:07:49,940
Continue to fire until the invader has been destroyed.

520
01:08:26,519 --> 01:08:28,646
General, the system is overheating, sir.

521
01:08:28,854 --> 01:08:32,775
We're going to hit it again and again 
and keep on hitting it until it's dead.

522
01:08:33,067 --> 01:08:35,611
But, sir. We're not even sure 
if it's having any effect on the creature.

523
01:08:35,820 --> 01:08:39,198
No effect? We've got them on the run, soldier.

524
01:08:39,406 --> 01:08:43,494
This is our moment of victory. I order you to fire.

525
01:08:43,619 --> 01:08:47,456
- The system won't allow us to fire again. 
- We'll see about that.

526
01:08:48,666 --> 01:08:52,503
Our shield is out. We're sitting ducks in here. 
Come on!

527
01:09:13,607 --> 01:09:16,735
This is not a good place to be.

528
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,735
This is not a good place to be.

529
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,205
Hey, are you all right?

530
01:09:28,414 --> 01:09:32,084
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.

531
01:10:10,915 --> 01:10:13,459
Sid, do you read me?

532
01:10:14,126 --> 01:10:16,253
Go ahead, I'm still here.

533
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:20,883
We're looking at Gaia. 
Do you hear me, Sid? Gaia.

534
01:10:21,091 --> 01:10:25,179
I think this explains why 
the eighth spirit appeared here.

535
01:10:26,347 --> 01:10:27,431
Yes.

536
01:10:27,973 --> 01:10:29,725
Yes, that's it!

537
01:10:29,934 --> 01:10:31,769
A Phantom must have changed into the eighth spirit...

538
01:10:31,769 --> 01:10:35,689
...when it touched a new life born from our own Gaia.

539
01:10:35,981 --> 01:10:39,235
If so, it would've been given 
a different energy signature...

540
01:10:39,443 --> 01:10:42,446
...that set it apart from the other Phantoms.

541
01:10:42,863 --> 01:10:45,908
You two could not have hoped 
for a better location...

542
01:10:46,241 --> 01:10:48,285
...to find a new compatible spirit.

543
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:52,873
Whatever you do, don't move. 
Stay right where you are.

544
01:10:53,916 --> 01:10:57,753
Staying right where we are 
may not be as easy as it sounds.

545
01:10:58,003 --> 01:11:00,172
Don't shoot any of them!

546
01:11:00,381 --> 01:11:03,175
You could very well destroy our last hope.

547
01:11:03,342 --> 01:11:06,428
And what do you suggest I do, doctor? 
Ask them to play nice?

548
01:11:06,637 --> 01:11:10,766
Combat strategy is your area 
of expertise, captain, not mine.

549
01:11:11,141 --> 01:11:14,520
I have a reading here in the fissure. 
Do you see it?

550
01:11:12,017 --> 01:11:14,520
I have a reading here in the fissure. 
Do you see it?

551
01:11:14,770 --> 01:11:19,650
Yes! A compatible spirit. 
It must be very near you.

552
01:11:19,817 --> 01:11:23,153
Well? Which one is it? Which one?

553
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:27,157
I'm having difficulty narrowing it down. 
Just a moment, please.

554
01:11:29,576 --> 01:11:33,372
Doctor, it's getting crowded in here. 
Aki, we don't have much time. Aki.

555
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,466
With the hope of new life...

556
01:13:07,674 --> 01:13:10,719
...has Gaia changed 
the Phantom within?

557
01:13:16,850 --> 01:13:18,143
I have it.

558
01:13:24,358 --> 01:13:27,152
Gray, get in here. I need you!

559
01:13:27,945 --> 01:13:30,989
Do you hear me, Sid? 
The wave pattern is complete.

560
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:34,451
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.

561
01:13:34,660 --> 01:13:37,538
I don't see how you could have found the final spirit.

562
01:13:37,788 --> 01:13:40,165
It found me, doctor.

563
01:13:42,042 --> 01:13:43,669
Oh, my word.

564
01:13:45,129 --> 01:13:47,005
I hope you know 
what you're doing, Aki.

565
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:49,508
- We can use the shield to project the wave. 
- What?

566
01:13:49,716 --> 01:13:53,220
Dr. Sid's theory was right. 
I have it. The eighth spirit.

567
01:13:53,679 --> 01:13:55,806
That's it. Shield on.

568
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:23,375
I'll blast you all to hell.

569
01:14:31,049 --> 01:14:32,676
Oh, no. No!

570
01:14:37,055 --> 01:14:38,307
Get down!

571
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:52,946
I know!

572
01:14:55,532 --> 01:14:57,534
But it must be done.

573
01:15:40,244 --> 01:15:41,286
Fire.

574
01:15:41,495 --> 01:15:43,205
Fire, damn you!

575
01:15:44,248 --> 01:15:45,374
Fire!

576
01:17:03,577 --> 01:17:05,787
Don't leave me, Gray.

577
01:17:06,997 --> 01:17:09,625
Told Sid this was a one-way trip.

578
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,044
Looks like I was right.

579
01:17:12,419 --> 01:17:14,796
No, Gray. Hang on, please.

580
01:17:15,005 --> 01:17:16,923
I still have the wave.

581
01:17:17,132 --> 01:17:19,176
We can get through this.

582
01:17:37,152 --> 01:17:38,403
Help me.

583
01:17:48,830 --> 01:17:50,624
Listen to me.

584
01:17:50,832 --> 01:17:54,961
You saved my life once. 
Now I want you to save yourself.

585
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:56,922
Gray, no. Please?

586
01:17:57,172 --> 01:18:00,425
Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.

587
01:18:21,029 --> 01:18:22,155
I love you.

588
01:20:11,681 --> 01:20:13,642
Oh, it's warm.
