1
00:02:03,331 --> 00:02:07,585
Every night, the same dream, 
the same strange planet.

2
00:02:07,961 --> 00:02:09,420
But why?

3
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:12,173
What are they trying to tell me?

4
00:02:17,011 --> 00:02:21,349
It's been 34 years 
since they arrived on this planet.

5
00:02:17,929 --> 00:02:21,349
It's been 34 years 
since they arrived on this planet.

6
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:24,018
And not a day passes 
that the survivors...

7
00:02:24,227 --> 00:02:28,064
...forced to live in barrier cities, 
do not live in fear.

8
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:30,400
I have vowed to end that fear.

9
00:02:30,650 --> 00:02:33,111
I believe my dreams hold the key.

10
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:37,866
The question is, will I be 
in time to save the Earth?

11
00:04:29,602 --> 00:04:31,270
Where are you?

12
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,751
This is a restricted area.

13
00:07:41,377 --> 00:07:42,628
Do not move!

14
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:46,215
- What's she doing here captain? 
- I don't know, but we're getting her out.

15
00:07:46,424 --> 00:07:49,302
- You're coming with us. 
- Behind you!

16
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,430
Hold it right there!

17
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,724
Damn it. Let's move, people!

18
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,815
Two coming through the wall!

19
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,736
Hold your fire. 
Those tanks are flammable!

20
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:11,657
Ryan, Neil, let's go!

21
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,888
Captain, the transport is not going 
to wait for us much longer.

22
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:37,058
- I understand that. 
- It's in bad shape.

23
00:08:37,225 --> 00:08:38,976
I need a minute to extract it.

24
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,312
Miss. That's a minute we do not have.

25
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,856
I'm afraid he's right about that ma'am.

26
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:47,068
Phantoms! We have incoming.

27
00:08:59,747 --> 00:09:01,624
Everyone, up top!

28
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:04,210
Go, go, go!

29
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:11,509
- Transport, requesting immediate evac. 
- Affirmative.

30
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,303
Up here!

31
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:23,854
- Captain! - They're right 
behind you! - Captain, come on!

32
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:29,151
I've got you!

33
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,196
- You okay? 
- Yeah.

34
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,949
All right, everybody, here they come.

35
00:10:11,986 --> 00:10:12,987
You okay?

36
00:11:11,337 --> 00:11:13,673
- Welcome back, captain. 
- We're clean.

37
00:11:13,923 --> 00:11:15,091
- Let's make sure of that shall we?

38
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,133
Yes, sir.

39
00:11:16,384 --> 00:11:17,593
- Yes, sir. 
- Yes, sir.

40
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,648
Okay, next.

41
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:37,071
You know, my security rating 
allows me to bypass this.

42
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:39,281
Not today it doesn't.

43
00:11:40,783 --> 00:11:41,992
Something's not right.

44
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,204
- About this mission? Or that woman? 
- Both.

45
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:46,497
Next.

46
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:54,380
Oh shit!

47
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,673
- Captain! 
- They got him.

48
00:11:55,923 --> 00:11:57,466
There must be a mistake.

49
00:11:57,758 --> 00:11:58,634
You came in contact with a Phantom sir. 
Please remain calm.

50
00:11:59,718 --> 00:12:02,930
Administering treatment shield.

51
00:12:03,222 --> 00:12:06,058
- What level is he? 
- Blue. It will be code red in 3-1/2 minutes.

52
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,229
We have to treat him. Now!

53
00:12:10,438 --> 00:12:12,648
I'm sorry, but that's impossible. 
We'll transfer him to the treatment center.

54
00:12:12,857 --> 00:12:14,733
There's no time for that.

55
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:21,073
Get him to the table.

56
00:12:21,323 --> 00:12:23,200
Hang in there, captain.

57
00:12:36,505 --> 00:12:38,007
Locating pathogens.

58
00:12:45,014 --> 00:12:47,224
Jesus, look at that thing!

59
00:12:47,975 --> 00:12:49,310
- How much more time? 
- Not enough.

60
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:50,686
When he reaches code red,

61
00:12:50,686 --> 00:12:54,190
the treatment shield won't be 
able to hold the alien particles.

62
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:56,817
Engaging bio-etheric laser.

63
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,088
We've lost contact. 
Infestation is moving deeper.

64
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:21,175
His treatment shield is failing.

65
00:13:21,759 --> 00:13:22,968
Found it.

66
00:13:32,645 --> 00:13:33,979
Come on.

67
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:10,307
It's all right.

68
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:15,980
Don't worry. 
You'll be back to normal in no time.

69
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:20,901
Uh.. Doctor, we need 
to scan you for infestation.

70
00:14:21,277 --> 00:14:24,863
That won't be necessary. 
I'll take responsibility.

71
00:14:27,741 --> 00:14:29,618
Hey, doc.

72
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:32,371
Thanks for saving him.

73
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:50,681
It's a match. We've found it.

74
00:14:50,931 --> 00:14:52,016
Yes.

75
00:14:52,349 --> 00:14:54,268
The sixth spirit.

76
00:14:54,518 --> 00:14:56,854
It seemed today you broke 
nearly every protocol.

77
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:59,857
How long do you think this would 
have survived outside the barrier?

78
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:02,443
Aki, you know there are 
elements in the council and

79
00:15:02,443 --> 00:15:04,862
military just waiting for 
an excuse to shut us down.

80
00:15:59,416 --> 00:16:03,671
If we attack the meteor with this, we will 
eliminate the Phantoms at their source.

81
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:05,631
General Hein, calm down.

82
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,841
At our last meeting, We voted 6 to 2...

83
00:16:08,050 --> 00:16:11,512
...to postpone using the Zeus cannon 
to attack the Leonid Meteor.

84
00:16:12,346 --> 00:16:15,015
We have re-convened today to vote 
on that very issue again.

85
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:19,645
Now, I'd like to ask the director 
of the Bio-Etheric Center to speak.

86
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,231
- Dr. Sid, please. 
- Thank you.

87
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,527
As you all know, the Phantoms' nest 
is in the Leonid Meteor...

88
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:29,238
...that landed here 34 years ago.

89
00:16:29,613 --> 00:16:34,201
What you see now are the records 
of every assault on the meteor to date.

90
00:16:34,410 --> 00:16:38,205
Physical attacks have had 
utterly no effect.

91
00:16:38,455 --> 00:16:42,418
This scene took place three months ago 
during a full-scale bombardment.

92
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:46,755
Now please note the Phantoms outside 
the meteor are indeed destroyed.

93
00:16:47,047 --> 00:16:50,843
However, inside, many that 
were dormant come to life...

94
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:55,431
...and as you see, 
overall Phantom density remains the same.

95
00:16:55,681 --> 00:16:58,392
The newly risen aliens 
respond to the attack...

96
00:16:58,642 --> 00:17:01,353
...by burrowing even 
deeper into the Earth.

97
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:04,231
Now, this is very interesting to me Dr. Sid...

98
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:07,526
...because we see 
the same thing during surgery...

99
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:12,239
...when using bio-etheric lasers 
on Phantom particles, do we not?

100
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,949
Yes, indeed we do.

101
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:16,702
You see. the injured particles escape...

102
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:20,080
...burying or digging themselves deeper 
into a patient's body.

103
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:25,210
And when we increase the laser power 
to destroy these deeper particles...

104
00:17:25,586 --> 00:17:29,548
...we have had incidents resulting in 
further injury to a patient...

105
00:17:29,757 --> 00:17:31,592
...and in some cases...

106
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,926
...death.

107
00:17:33,343 --> 00:17:35,220
And what exactly does that mean doctor?

108
00:17:35,471 --> 00:17:37,890
It means there's a very good chance...

109
00:17:38,098 --> 00:17:41,351
...the beam from the Zeus cannon 
will burn the Phantoms in the meteor.

110
00:17:41,643 --> 00:17:42,728
Exactly! Thank you.

111
00:17:42,936 --> 00:17:47,608
However, it also means that 
the beam energy may be too strong...

112
00:17:47,858 --> 00:17:49,276
...injuring the Earth.

113
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,487
Injure the Earth?

114
00:17:51,862 --> 00:17:53,781
You mean the Gaia.

115
00:17:53,989 --> 00:17:56,950
- I mean... 
- You mean the spirit of the Earth.

116
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:02,289
Yes, the spirit of the Earth.

117
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:04,792
Did he say what I think he said?

118
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:06,126
What are you doing?

119
00:18:06,335 --> 00:18:09,254
I know what I'm doing and 
whatever you do, keep your mouth shut.

120
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:10,672
This is ridiculous.

121
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:12,633
Dr. Sid, the Gaia theory 
has not been proven.

122
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:17,679
Even if Gaia does exist, won't we 
still have to remove the Phantoms?

123
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:21,100
I think if there's any chance of success, 
we should take it.

124
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:23,435
- Don't you agree? 
- Well, of course i do.

125
00:18:23,644 --> 00:18:26,105
But there is an alternative 
to the space cannon.

126
00:18:26,313 --> 00:18:27,439
Another method?

127
00:18:27,648 --> 00:18:31,110
- Yes. A means of disabling the Phantoms. 
- Please.

128
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:36,448
As we know, the aliens display 
a distinct energy pattern.

129
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:40,828
Now, it is a fact that 
two opposing bio-etheric waves...

130
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:43,580
...placed one over the other 
will cancel each other out.

131
00:18:43,789 --> 00:18:47,084
It is theoretically possible 
to construct a wave pattern...

132
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:49,419
...in direct opposition 
to the Phantom energy.

133
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:52,798
We are currently assembling such 
a wave and are nearing completion.

134
00:18:53,006 --> 00:18:54,633
Members of the council...

135
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:58,011
...gathering plants and animals...

136
00:18:58,220 --> 00:19:01,640
...from around the world to fight 
the Phantoms is utter nonsense.

137
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:05,811
The Zeus cannon is a proven, 
effective weapon.

138
00:19:06,061 --> 00:19:08,730
It will kill Phantoms.

139
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:11,942
Can we afford to wait 
for some crazy invention...

140
00:19:12,150 --> 00:19:16,446
...some army of 
touchy-feely plants and animals...

141
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,658
...An invention that offers no solid evidence 
that it will destroy the aliens?

142
00:19:19,867 --> 00:19:21,034
There is evidence!

143
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,537
Our partially completed energy wave...

144
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:26,331
...has successfully stopped 
Phantom particles from spreading...

145
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:29,042
...through a terminally-infected patient.

146
00:19:29,376 --> 00:19:32,421
Doctor, do you claim to have evidence 
that a terminal patient has been cured?

147
00:19:32,671 --> 00:19:35,799
Not cured. The wave is not complete.

148
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:40,512
But we've succeeded in containing the 
particles safely inside the patient.

149
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:58,447
You may have bought us some time Aki, 
but i wonder at what cost?

150
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:01,992
Doctor, I can't keep hiding 
in the background while you protect me.

151
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:05,204
I want what life I have left 
to mean something.

152
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:08,832
Will you listen to me? When we find 
the seventh and eighth spirits...

153
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,002
If we find them. 
What we need now is some luck.

154
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:15,088
Luck has nothing to do with it.

155
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:17,674
Faith and hard work, girl...

156
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:21,428
...coz I'll be damned if 
you're going to die before me.

157
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,069
Captain Edwards...

158
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:24,074
...you extracted a Dr. Ross from 
Old New York several days ago did you not?

159
00:21:24,283 --> 00:21:27,577
- Yes, sir. 
- What were your impressions of Dr. Ross?

160
00:21:27,911 --> 00:21:31,248
She seemed very capable and determined, sir.

161
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:34,876
You and the Deep Eyes are being 
temporarily reassigned.

162
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:38,296
You will guard Dr. Ross 
when she reenters the wasteland.

163
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:42,592
- Understood, sir. 
- You don't understand yet, captain.

164
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:47,139
Report any aberrant behavior 
in Dr. Ross to the major immediately.

165
00:21:47,347 --> 00:21:48,598
Aberrant behavior sir?

166
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:53,979
The woman carries an alien infestation, captain. 
We don't know what it may be doing to her.

167
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,606
The alien presence could be affecting her judgment.

168
00:21:56,815 --> 00:21:59,818
They may be manipulating the doctor 
for their very own purposes.

169
00:22:00,068 --> 00:22:02,904
She's had prolonged exposure 
to Phantom tissue.

170
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:05,824
If this begins to manifest itself in any way...

171
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:10,829
...Dr. Ross is to be placed under arrest 
and transported here for observation.

172
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,292
It is, in fact, for her own good, captain.

173
00:22:15,542 --> 00:22:16,626
Of course, sir.

174
00:23:56,101 --> 00:23:59,771
I'm convinced that these dreams 
are some form of communication.

175
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,982
Their message still eludes me...

176
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:06,653
...but they're coming faster now 
and that can only mean one thing.

177
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:10,073
The Phantoms inside me are beginning to win.

178
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:13,410
Our target is 50 klicks west of Tucson.

179
00:24:14,119 --> 00:24:15,162
- Roger. 
- Phantom concentration?

180
00:24:15,370 --> 00:24:17,789
Not good. We've got big metas everywhere.

181
00:24:17,998 --> 00:24:19,833
So it's gonna be a real picnic.

182
00:24:20,041 --> 00:24:23,837
Stick close to me. No heroics today. Okay? 
Everything by the book.

183
00:24:24,045 --> 00:24:25,881
By the book. Right.

184
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,974
If we drop energy buoys here, 
here and here...

185
00:24:36,224 --> 00:24:38,018
...we should be able to 
land, acquire the target,

186
00:24:38,018 --> 00:24:40,061
and get out before the Phantoms 
even know we were there.

187
00:24:40,270 --> 00:24:42,355
And the buoys will attract the Phantoms?

188
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:44,524
- Yeah. 
- For a while.

189
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:57,204
So you're from the 307th's right? 
Under General Hein?

190
00:24:57,412 --> 00:25:01,541
Ever done wasteland recon before? 
It can get pretty ugly.

191
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:33,532
Captain, rendezvous for evac at 
vector 6, coordinate 279.

192
00:25:34,616 --> 00:25:37,202
Roger that. Stay alert for hostiles.

193
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,722
Looks like they've taken the bait.

194
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,449
The seventh spirit should be 
just beyond that line of wreckage.

195
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:19,536
I don't see how any living thing 
could survive out here?

196
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:21,079
We'll find out soon enough.

197
00:26:23,748 --> 00:26:26,501
This was the Phantom Cleansing Mission.

198
00:26:26,751 --> 00:26:29,254
It was supposed to end the war.

199
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,426
My father's in here somewhere.

200
00:26:37,470 --> 00:26:38,555
All right.

201
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:41,016
Let's move out, people.

202
00:26:57,198 --> 00:26:58,450
I'll be damned.

203
00:26:58,658 --> 00:26:59,743
A survivor.

204
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:02,537
What's it doing out here?

205
00:27:02,746 --> 00:27:04,622
Hoping for life to return.

206
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:07,834
Is that our spirit, doc?

207
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:10,837
No.

208
00:27:25,018 --> 00:27:26,728
We're closing in on the life form.

209
00:27:26,936 --> 00:27:30,899
- Distance? 
- Hard to say. We're very close.

210
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,443
I don't see anything.

211
00:27:38,865 --> 00:27:42,369
- You're not gonna tell me it's him? 
- That's impossible.

212
00:27:50,752 --> 00:27:52,545
It's not the soldier. It's his ovo-pac.

213
00:27:52,754 --> 00:27:56,675
How do you explain that? The pacs power 
our weapons, the barrier cities...

214
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,635
I mean it's just bio-etheric energy.

215
00:27:58,843 --> 00:28:02,263
And to create that energy we use 
living tissue. Single-cell organisms.

216
00:28:02,472 --> 00:28:05,266
- You're telling me his backpack is the seventh spirit? 
- Yes.

217
00:28:05,475 --> 00:28:07,352
We have incoming. Captain? Do you read me?

218
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:08,645
- Captain? 
- What? Say again?

219
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,772
You read me captain? We have incoming.

220
00:28:11,022 --> 00:28:12,899
Ryan, get the soldier's pac.

221
00:28:30,417 --> 00:28:32,627
I need a hand! Sarge!

222
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:39,926
- Those buoys? They're not working. 
- Yeah.

223
00:28:42,846 --> 00:28:45,640
- Are you all right? 
- Of course I am.

224
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,600
Let's get the hell out of here!

225
00:28:51,271 --> 00:28:53,314
Something's not right. 
This shouldn't be happening.

226
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,817
Something's attracting them.

227
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:57,902
Aki!

228
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:06,286
- They're right on us, sir. Closing in fast! 
- Jane, take the lead.

229
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:22,302
Fire in the hole!

230
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:36,733
Get us out of here, Neil.

231
00:29:37,358 --> 00:29:39,402
- Sir, I would love to, but... 
- Just do it!

232
00:30:05,428 --> 00:30:06,679
- Sir? 
- It's okay, that's it.

233
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:10,058
That doesn't look good, captain.

234
00:30:10,725 --> 00:30:12,519
We have to get her to a hospital.

235
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:16,314
- You have your orders, sir. 
- What the hell is going on here?

236
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:20,276
Dr. Ross is to be taken into custody now, sir.

237
00:30:24,572 --> 00:30:26,533
Lower your weapons. That's an order!

238
00:30:26,783 --> 00:30:28,743
Sir. We have no choice, 
but to relieve you of your command.

239
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:31,454
I won't let you do this soldier. 
You'll gonna have to shoot me.

240
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,289
Stand down, captain!

241
00:31:57,165 --> 00:31:59,250
Hang on, everyone!

242
00:32:03,963 --> 00:32:08,051
That's enough. 
Hands where I can see them. Everyone now!

243
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:20,313
Deep Eyes, hard to starboard!

244
00:32:41,417 --> 00:32:44,420
The Deep Eyes are returning 
from the wasteland, sir.

245
00:32:44,629 --> 00:32:46,214
Apparently, there was an incident.

246
00:32:46,506 --> 00:32:49,300
It would seem the Phantoms 
were attracted to Dr. Ross.

247
00:32:49,550 --> 00:32:52,762
The crew barely escaped with their lives.

248
00:32:52,970 --> 00:32:55,473
And sir, Captain Edwards is still in command.

249
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,183
Issue an order.

250
00:32:57,392 --> 00:33:00,353
I want Edwards and Dr. Ross 
placed under arrest.

251
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:03,856
All research materials pertaining 
to Dr. Sid's wave theory...

252
00:33:04,065 --> 00:33:05,692
...are to be confiscated immediately.

253
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:08,820
That might not go over 
too well with the council, sir.

254
00:33:09,028 --> 00:33:11,447
What a tragedy that would be.

255
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,952
This is perfect, major. 
The good captain has opened the door for us.

256
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,163
By tomorrow morning, 
the council will be at our feet...

257
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,792
...thanking us for exposing 
the traitors and imploring us...

258
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,128
...to save them from the Phantoms.

259
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:31,384
How is she, doctor?

260
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:35,638
- She is dying. 
- There must be something you can do.

261
00:33:35,930 --> 00:33:38,224
Aki is fighting with 
only six of the eight spirits.

262
00:33:38,433 --> 00:33:40,643
We'll have to implant the seventh 
directly into her chest plate.

263
00:33:41,728 --> 00:33:44,188
It took a bullet. 
I think it might be damaged.

264
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,566
We have to repair this panel quickly.

265
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:52,321
Her vital signs are dropping. 
Aki is slipping away from us.

266
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:57,577
She needs a sympathetic spirit 
to help hold her in this world.

267
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:02,457
And I can think of no spirit better suited 
for that task than yours, captain.

268
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:06,419
- I don't understand. 
- You don't have to understand.

269
00:34:06,878 --> 00:34:08,838
You just be with her now.

270
00:34:09,964 --> 00:34:12,049
You keep her here with us.

271
00:35:04,143 --> 00:35:06,479
Aki? Where are we?

272
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:08,564
On an alien planet.

273
00:35:08,773 --> 00:35:10,399
How is that possible?

274
00:35:12,026 --> 00:35:14,195
I'm not entirely sure.

275
00:35:14,403 --> 00:35:15,905
You seem pretty calm.

276
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,367
I've been having this dream 
every night for months.

277
00:35:19,575 --> 00:35:20,618
Dream?

278
00:35:21,202 --> 00:35:23,329
Well, whatever it is.

279
00:35:25,248 --> 00:35:27,750
You're really here, aren't you?

280
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:30,920
What's happening to me?

281
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:35,967
Dr. Sid is implanting the seventh spirit 
directly into your body.

282
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,889
Something you should see here, sir.

283
00:35:49,605 --> 00:35:51,858
And I am watching what, major?

284
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:55,528
It seems Dr. Ross has been recording her dreams.

285
00:35:55,736 --> 00:35:58,322
And why would I be interested in...

286
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:00,992
...her dreams?

287
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:03,661
This is it. This is our evidence.

288
00:36:03,870 --> 00:36:06,330
She's under the influence of the Phantoms.

289
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:13,588
Dr. Ross' dreams should be all the council needs 
to authorize the firing of the Zeus cannon.

290
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:17,174
The council is content to hide 
powering inside this barrier...

291
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:19,927
...while the world dies a little more every day.

292
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:22,930
I believe they need a push 
in the right direction, major.

293
00:36:23,139 --> 00:36:25,892
Get together a group of your most trusted men.

294
00:37:17,735 --> 00:37:19,862
What are they doing. 
Why are they staring at us?

295
00:37:20,071 --> 00:37:21,614
Not at us.

296
00:38:12,206 --> 00:38:14,166
Welcome back, captain.

297
00:38:16,919 --> 00:38:18,129
Is it over?

298
00:38:19,046 --> 00:38:20,715
How is she, doctor?

299
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:23,134
She's gonna be fine. 
But this is only temporary.

300
00:38:23,384 --> 00:38:26,929
We'll need to find the eighth 
and final spirit to cure her.

301
00:38:30,057 --> 00:38:32,560
Aki, can you hear me?

302
00:38:34,895 --> 00:38:36,522
I finished it.

303
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,566
I know what it means.

304
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:41,527
I know what the Phantoms really are.

305
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,032
Nobody move! You're all under arrest!

306
00:38:56,959 --> 00:38:58,377
We have them, sir.

307
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:00,755
Sir?

308
00:39:01,297 --> 00:39:03,507
My wife and daughter...

309
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:10,348
...were killed by Phantoms in the 
San Francisco Barrier City was attacked.

310
00:39:10,556 --> 00:39:12,516
Did I ever tell you that?

311
00:39:16,979 --> 00:39:19,148
You've lost family, haven't you?

312
00:39:19,607 --> 00:39:20,816
Yes, sir.

313
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,319
That's why I trust you.

314
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:27,615
You know what must be done.

315
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:37,291
Security override.

316
00:39:37,583 --> 00:39:40,252
Perimeter breached.

317
00:39:41,796 --> 00:39:44,090
Major, arrest these men.

318
00:39:44,673 --> 00:39:47,676
- Take it easy. 
- Stand up. Go.

319
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:51,639
You are relieved of your post. 
Don't ask any questions.

320
00:39:53,516 --> 00:39:55,267
Reduce power to Sector 31.

321
00:39:55,476 --> 00:39:57,478
Sir, you do realize that the Phantoms...

322
00:39:57,728 --> 00:39:59,105
What I realize, major...

323
00:39:59,313 --> 00:40:03,275
...is that we must force the council 
to take action against the enemy.

324
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,993
25% of energy pipe alpha redirected.

325
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,705
Lowering power output to Sector 31.

326
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:20,960
Barrier breached in Sector 31, general. 
They're coming through now.

327
00:40:21,127 --> 00:40:24,338
Oh I think we can easily handle 
a few Phantoms in a contained space.

328
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:30,219
Relax, major. When this night's over, 
you're going to be a hero.

329
00:40:32,012 --> 00:40:35,808
Alright. Why do you think 
we've never been able to determine...

330
00:40:36,016 --> 00:40:40,187
...a relationship between the human-sized Phantoms 
and the giant ones roaming the wastelands?

331
00:40:40,479 --> 00:40:43,399
He's right. If you've spent as much time 
in the field as we had...

332
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:47,111
...you know there is no relationship. 
It's like a zoo out there.

333
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:50,990
Precisely. I think the giant ones are 
like our whales or elephants.

334
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:55,494
But why would an invading army bring 
a bunch of whales and elephants along for the ride?

335
00:40:55,744 --> 00:40:58,497
Unless their ship was kind of 
a crazy Noah's Ark?

336
00:40:59,081 --> 00:41:01,459
We have always assumed that the meteor...

337
00:41:01,709 --> 00:41:04,879
...was intended as a form of transportation. 
Perhaps it wasn't.

338
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:08,382
The meteor is a chunk of their planet 
that got thrown into space...

339
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,758
...when they destroyed their world.

340
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:14,471
But how could they survive the trip 
across outer space on a hunk of rock?

341
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,182
They didn't.

342
00:41:20,394 --> 00:41:24,064
I think that explains why we never had a chance.

343
00:41:24,356 --> 00:41:27,860
All our strategies are based on one assumption:

344
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:31,071
That we were fighting alien invaders.

345
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,116
Think of the dream, Gray. How they died.

346
00:41:34,325 --> 00:41:37,161
Since then, all they've known is suffering.

347
00:41:37,369 --> 00:41:39,246
They're not an invading army.

348
00:41:39,455 --> 00:41:41,165
They're ghosts.

349
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:44,251
How many Phantoms?

350
00:41:44,502 --> 00:41:46,295
More than enough to convince the council, sir.

351
00:41:46,545 --> 00:41:49,924
Excellent. Sound an alert. Send 
a squad out to eliminate them.

352
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:50,841
Yes sir.

353
00:41:51,091 --> 00:41:53,636
Alert status. Full deployment.

354
00:41:53,886 --> 00:41:55,596
Sir. I have numerous Phantom contacts!

355
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:57,306
Well, of course you do.

356
00:41:57,515 --> 00:42:00,351
Outside of Sector 31, sir. 
And moving at incredible speed.

357
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,353
Major, What the hell is going on here?

358
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:03,938
They're in the pipes.

359
00:42:04,146 --> 00:42:06,690
They're moving with the bio-etheric energy flow.

360
00:42:06,941 --> 00:42:10,819
That's impossible. No living thing 
could survive in those pipes.

361
00:42:11,320 --> 00:42:15,366
Well, we've got a big one heading this way. 
Meta class, sir.

362
00:42:22,748 --> 00:42:24,124
Oh, my God.

363
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,126
Hold your fire!

364
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:14,466
What have I done?

365
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,475
- Here they come. 
- But the others! Dr. Sid!

366
00:44:04,683 --> 00:44:06,977
Deep Eyes'll take care of him. 
Come on.

367
00:44:14,443 --> 00:44:16,570
What's happening. Why can we see them now?

368
00:44:16,820 --> 00:44:20,157
They must be carrying a residual charge 
from passing through the barrier.

369
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,372
Behind you!

370
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:30,060
All aboard, captain!

371
00:46:37,920 --> 00:46:38,962
We need to find my ship.

372
00:46:39,171 --> 00:46:41,840
If it was towed inside the city, 
it would be in the military hangar.

373
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:43,801
That's a big "if. "

374
00:46:52,768 --> 00:46:53,977
Look out!

375
00:47:01,902 --> 00:47:03,987
- Get us onto the platform. 
- You got it.

376
00:47:19,711 --> 00:47:20,796
Hang on, everybody!

377
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:40,732
- Captain.

378
00:47:46,029 --> 00:47:48,490
Oh, God. Talk to me, sarge.

379
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,033
Ouch!

380
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,577
- Give me a hand, Jane. 
- Right.

381
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:55,872
No wait! We're risking further injury. 
We need the proper tools to cut him out.

382
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,374
They're in my ship.

383
00:47:58,792 --> 00:48:02,254
- No. No, doc. No drugs. 
- Captain?

384
00:48:02,462 --> 00:48:03,714
You heard the man.

385
00:48:04,423 --> 00:48:06,008
We'll find the ship and be back for you.

386
00:48:06,258 --> 00:48:08,010
- I'll stay with him. 
- Me too.

387
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:09,803
Nobody's staying.

388
00:48:11,013 --> 00:48:12,931
- Just give me a gun. 
- You got it.

389
00:48:13,140 --> 00:48:15,684
Give him a weapon. Do it!

390
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:19,980
We'll be back for you, sergeant.

391
00:48:20,314 --> 00:48:21,398
You hear me?

392
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:24,901
I hear you, captain. 
Now, get out of here.

393
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:26,737
Let's move out.

394
00:49:17,746 --> 00:49:20,082
A quad-axle ATV. This is good.

395
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:24,378
It can be used to retrieve Ryan 
and transport him safely here.

396
00:49:24,586 --> 00:49:27,756
However, we'll need to replace 
these spent fuel cells.

397
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,467
There could be some live ovo-pacs in the hangar.

398
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:43,271
Gray, be careful.

399
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:44,690
You too.

400
00:50:27,149 --> 00:50:28,233
Oh, yeah.

401
00:50:43,915 --> 00:50:45,417
Neil, do you read me?

402
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:47,169
Loud and clear, captain.

403
00:50:47,419 --> 00:50:49,212
This baby'll fly itself.

404
00:50:56,803 --> 00:50:58,096
Flight path is set.

405
00:50:58,305 --> 00:50:59,765
Beginning rotation.

406
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,520
Stop the airtray. We have a problem.

407
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:08,315
I'm reading an impound tractor 
attached probably to the ship.

408
00:51:22,162 --> 00:51:23,663
There's the problem.

409
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,091
The controls are locked, naturally.

410
00:51:49,523 --> 00:51:51,274
What's happening down there?

411
00:51:51,525 --> 00:51:54,027
Nothing we can't handle.

412
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,042
- Neil, what's your status? 
- Almost there.

413
00:52:09,376 --> 00:52:10,919
I want you two back inside.

414
00:52:11,127 --> 00:52:14,881
We're fine, sir. Jane is negotiating 
with extreme prejudice.

415
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,341
Talk to me, Jane.

416
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:20,011
No problem here, captain.

417
00:52:25,517 --> 00:52:28,145
Yes! Captain, we are good to go.

418
00:53:08,226 --> 00:53:09,936
Jane, get out of there.

419
00:53:10,270 --> 00:53:13,398
Get out of there now! Go! Jane!

420
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:15,567
Get the hell out of there!

421
00:53:42,886 --> 00:53:45,597
The shield is powered and ready.

422
00:53:45,805 --> 00:53:47,182
- Where are you going? 
- To the cockpit.

423
00:53:47,390 --> 00:53:50,477
The ship is set on autopilot. 
We're in countdown to liftoff.

424
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:54,064
No, wait. It's too dangerous. Aki!

425
00:54:17,963 --> 00:54:20,173
Over here, you son of a bitch!

426
00:56:25,131 --> 00:56:27,217
Gray, come on!

427
00:59:28,940 --> 00:59:30,817
I enlarged the scanning perimeter...

428
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,820
...to include an area that 
we had previously overlooked.

429
00:59:34,028 --> 00:59:35,822
The impact crater.

430
00:59:36,864 --> 00:59:38,908
That's a strange place to find the eighth spirit.

431
00:59:39,117 --> 00:59:40,743
Yes, really quite astonishing.

432
00:59:40,952 --> 00:59:43,288
But nothing could survive in there except Phantoms.

433
00:59:43,496 --> 00:59:44,622
Precisely.

434
00:59:44,956 --> 00:59:48,126
Which suggests that 
the eighth spirit is a Phantom spirit.

435
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:51,546
I can't explain it at the moment, 
but once we get down there...

436
00:59:51,754 --> 00:59:55,049
- ... you will understand... 
- Wait, doctor. That's a one-way trip.

437
00:59:55,258 --> 00:59:58,344
Yes, I expected that's how 
you would evaluate our chances.

438
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,013
Well, am I wrong?

439
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,556
No, I agree. We probably...

440
01:00:01,806 --> 01:00:05,018
...won't live long enough to extract 
the eighth spirit from the crater.

441
01:00:05,226 --> 01:00:05,893
Then why should we even try it?

442
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:09,105
Because we don't need to extract the eighth spirit.

443
01:00:09,314 --> 01:00:11,107
If we can't bring the final spirit here...

444
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,860
...we can go there and complete 
the wave inside the crater.

445
01:00:14,068 --> 01:00:15,486
Yes, exactly.

446
01:00:15,695 --> 01:00:17,655
And how do we do that, exactly?

447
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,949
I can construct a device that...

448
01:00:20,158 --> 01:00:24,454
...would attach to Aki's chest plate 
to gather the eighth spirit and then...

449
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:26,748
And then what?

450
01:00:27,081 --> 01:00:30,251
And then we wait 
and see what happens.

451
01:01:00,490 --> 01:01:03,201
What caused the barrier 
to fail, General Hein?

452
01:01:04,994 --> 01:01:06,829
I'm afraid it was 
only a matter of time...

453
01:01:07,038 --> 01:01:10,249
...before the Phantoms developed 
an immunity to our barriers.

454
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:13,127
But I am relieved to see that you 
and the rest of the council...

455
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:16,839
...were able to evacuate to Houston without incident.

456
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,759
It was a terrible loss suffered this evening.

457
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:23,012
The council has reconsidered 
your proposal to fire the Zeus cannon.

458
01:01:23,221 --> 01:01:24,430
I see.

459
01:01:24,806 --> 01:01:27,016
We are transmitting the access codes to you now.

460
01:01:29,018 --> 01:01:30,311
And, general...

461
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:33,898
...best of luck to us all.

462
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:38,403
Prepare to fire the cannon.

463
01:01:38,653 --> 01:01:39,737
The target, sir?

464
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:43,241
The Phantom crater.

465
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:14,230
Preparing to drop in three, two, one.

466
01:02:18,776 --> 01:02:20,486
Powering the shield.

467
01:02:23,448 --> 01:02:25,241
Okay, we're over the meteor.

468
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:26,951
Do you have it in sight, doctor?

469
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:30,496
There are so many of them.

470
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:33,458
Wait.

471
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:37,795
Yes! I'm tracking the eighth spirit 
moving along the crater's surface.

472
01:02:38,379 --> 01:02:41,507
All right. Now let's take a closer look.

473
01:03:21,714 --> 01:03:23,424
Ready to fire in three minutes.

474
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:27,428
Ovo-pacs at maximum. 
Transferring plasma flow to auto.

475
01:03:27,929 --> 01:03:29,931
Counter-thrusters are engaged.

476
01:03:30,139 --> 01:03:32,975
Lox flow de-coupled. Status is green.

477
01:03:33,184 --> 01:03:36,979
We have something on radar 
over the impact site, sir.

478
01:03:39,148 --> 01:03:40,483
It's her.

479
01:03:40,733 --> 01:03:41,859
Sir?

480
01:03:42,068 --> 01:03:44,570
Just a traitor under 
the influence of the enemy.

481
01:03:44,779 --> 01:03:46,531
Continue the countdown.

482
01:03:46,739 --> 01:03:49,742
We'll take them all out at the same time.

483
01:03:53,120 --> 01:03:57,124
We're closing on the Phantom. 
Contact in 30 seconds.

484
01:03:58,459 --> 01:03:59,877
Target locked.

485
01:04:00,127 --> 01:04:02,797
Ready to fire on your command.

486
01:04:06,592 --> 01:04:09,220
It's a match! It's a perfect match!

487
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,222
- Target scanners ready, sir. 
- Fire.

488
01:04:46,173 --> 01:04:47,341
What was that?

489
01:04:47,592 --> 01:04:50,052
It's the Zeus. They're firing on the crater.

490
01:04:50,303 --> 01:04:53,723
- Aki, Captain, are you all right? 
- A little shaken. Stand by.

491
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:58,477
Sid, the eighth spirit is not 
on our scanner. Do you have it?

492
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,730
The eighth spirit...

493
01:05:01,689 --> 01:05:03,190
...has been destroyed.

494
01:05:03,858 --> 01:05:07,695
- What are we going to do now? 
- Nothing. This mission is over.

495
01:05:08,029 --> 01:05:09,822
- We have to get out of here. 
- Incoming!

496
01:05:41,687 --> 01:05:43,397
What is that?

497
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:46,942
If you're getting us out of here, 
you better do it now.

498
01:05:58,829 --> 01:05:59,914
Hold on!

499
01:06:09,256 --> 01:06:11,217
I can't hold on to you.

500
01:06:15,846 --> 01:06:18,349
Unable to maintain altitude.

501
01:06:25,481 --> 01:06:27,984
Initiate emergency landing procedures.

502
01:06:51,799 --> 01:06:54,260
Come in. Come in, please.

503
01:06:54,510 --> 01:06:57,346
Aki, Gray, can you hear me?

504
01:06:57,596 --> 01:07:01,517
Sid, I need to talk to the station. 
Can you patch us through?

505
01:07:04,019 --> 01:07:06,939
- What is that thing? 
- I don't know, sir.

506
01:07:07,189 --> 01:07:09,400
Incoming message, sir.

507
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:12,111
General Hein, 
You must cease fire immediately.

508
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:16,699
What you are looking at in the crater is the 
living spirit of an alien's home world.

509
01:07:16,907 --> 01:07:19,493
Their planet was destroyed 
and part of it landed here.

510
01:07:19,744 --> 01:07:22,329
This is not an invasion. It never was.

511
01:07:21,704 --> 01:07:26,959
I see and what have we been fighting 
all this time, doctor? Ghosts?

512
01:07:27,209 --> 01:07:31,797
Yes. Spirits that are confused, 
lost and angry.

513
01:07:32,048 --> 01:07:34,717
Right. And these spirits are 
coming out of this Gaia thing.

514
01:07:34,967 --> 01:07:36,552
General Hein, you have to listen.

515
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:40,347
Alien Gaia, Earth Gaia. 
Doctor, even if I believed in such nonsense...

516
01:07:40,681 --> 01:07:43,434
...the fact remains the Earth 
is under attack from an aggressor...

517
01:07:43,642 --> 01:07:45,936
...who must be destroyed at all costs.

518
01:07:46,228 --> 01:07:48,689
The cost may be the entire planet, sir.

519
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:51,776
Firing on the alien Gaia will only make it stronger.

520
01:07:52,067 --> 01:07:56,363
Well, since you're under the alien's influence, doctor, 
I will take your protest to mean that we are...

521
01:07:56,614 --> 01:07:58,532
...in fact pursuing the correct course of actions.

522
01:07:58,741 --> 01:08:03,245
So i suggest you take your last few moments 
and prepare to meet your Gaia.

523
01:08:03,370 --> 01:08:06,499
Continue to fire until the invader has been destroyed.

524
01:08:43,077 --> 01:08:45,204
General, the system is overheating, sir.

525
01:08:45,412 --> 01:08:49,333
We're going to hit it again and again 
and keep on hitting it until it's dead.

526
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:52,169
But, sir. We're not even sure 
if it's having any effect on the creature.

527
01:08:52,378 --> 01:08:55,756
No effect? We've got them on the run, soldier.

528
01:08:55,965 --> 01:09:00,052
This is our moment of victory. I order you to fire.

529
01:09:00,177 --> 01:09:04,014
- The system won't allow us to fire again. 
- We'll see about that.

530
01:09:05,224 --> 01:09:09,061
Our shield is out. We're sitting ducks in here. 
Come on!

531
01:09:30,165 --> 01:09:33,294
This is not a good place to be.

532
01:09:31,041 --> 01:09:33,294
This is not a good place to be.

533
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:44,763
Hey, are you all right?

534
01:09:44,972 --> 01:09:48,642
I'm fine. I have to talk to Dr. Sid.

535
01:10:27,473 --> 01:10:30,017
Sid, do you read me?

536
01:10:30,684 --> 01:10:32,811
Go ahead, I'm still here.

537
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:37,441
We're looking at Gaia. 
Do you hear me, Sid? Gaia.

538
01:10:37,650 --> 01:10:41,737
I think this explains why 
the eighth spirit appeared here.

539
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:43,989
Yes.

540
01:10:44,531 --> 01:10:46,283
Yes, that's it!

541
01:10:46,492 --> 01:10:48,327
A Phantom must have changed into the eighth spirit...

542
01:10:48,327 --> 01:10:52,248
...when it touched a new life born from our own Gaia.

543
01:10:52,539 --> 01:10:55,793
If so, it would've been given 
a different energy signature...

544
01:10:56,001 --> 01:10:59,004
...that set it apart from the other Phantoms.

545
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,466
You two could not have hoped 
for a better location...

546
01:11:02,800 --> 01:11:04,843
...to find a new compatible spirit.

547
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:09,431
Whatever you do, don't move. 
Stay right where you are.

548
01:11:10,474 --> 01:11:14,311
Staying right where we are 
may not be as easy as it sounds.

549
01:11:14,561 --> 01:11:16,730
Don't shoot any of them!

550
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:19,733
You could very well destroy our last hope.

551
01:11:19,900 --> 01:11:22,987
And what do you suggest I do, doctor? 
Ask them to play nice?

552
01:11:23,195 --> 01:11:27,324
Combat strategy is your area 
of expertise, captain, not mine.

553
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,078
I have a reading here in the fissure. 
Do you see it?

554
01:11:28,575 --> 01:11:31,078
I have a reading here in the fissure. 
Do you see it?

555
01:11:31,328 --> 01:11:36,208
Yes! A compatible spirit. 
It must be very near you.

556
01:11:36,375 --> 01:11:39,712
Well? Which one is it? Which one?

557
01:11:39,920 --> 01:11:43,716
I'm having difficulty narrowing it down. 
Just a moment, please.

558
01:11:46,135 --> 01:11:49,930
Doctor, it's getting crowded in here. 
Aki, we don't have much time. Aki.

559
01:13:21,772 --> 01:13:24,024
With the hope of new life...

560
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:27,277
...has Gaia changed 
the Phantom within?

561
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:34,701
I have it.

562
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,710
Gray, get in here. I need you!

563
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:47,548
Do you hear me, Sid? 
The wave pattern is complete.

564
01:13:47,756 --> 01:13:51,009
Yes, I read you. This is wonderful.

565
01:13:51,218 --> 01:13:54,096
I don't see how you could have found the final spirit.

566
01:13:54,346 --> 01:13:56,723
It found me, doctor.

567
01:13:58,600 --> 01:14:00,227
Oh, my word.

568
01:14:01,687 --> 01:14:03,564
I hope you know 
what you're doing, Aki.

569
01:14:03,564 --> 01:14:06,066
- We can use the shield to project the wave. 
- What?

570
01:14:06,275 --> 01:14:09,778
Dr. Sid's theory was right. 
I have it. The eighth spirit.

571
01:14:10,237 --> 01:14:12,364
That's it. Shield on.

572
01:14:38,140 --> 01:14:39,933
I'll blast you all to hell.

573
01:14:47,608 --> 01:14:49,234
Oh, no. No!

574
01:14:53,614 --> 01:14:54,865
Get down!

575
01:15:08,045 --> 01:15:09,505
I know!

576
01:15:12,090 --> 01:15:14,092
But it must be done.

577
01:15:56,802 --> 01:15:57,844
Fire.

578
01:15:58,053 --> 01:15:59,763
Fire, damn you!

579
01:16:00,806 --> 01:16:01,932
Fire!

580
01:17:20,135 --> 01:17:22,346
Don't leave me, Gray.

581
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:26,183
Told Sid this was a one-way trip.

582
01:17:27,017 --> 01:17:28,602
Looks like I was right.

583
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,355
No, Gray. Hang on, please.

584
01:17:31,563 --> 01:17:33,482
I still have the wave.

585
01:17:33,690 --> 01:17:35,734
We can get through this.

586
01:17:53,710 --> 01:17:54,961
Help me.

587
01:18:05,389 --> 01:18:07,182
Listen to me.

588
01:18:07,391 --> 01:18:11,520
You saved my life once. 
Now I want you to save yourself.

589
01:18:11,770 --> 01:18:13,480
Gray, no. Please?

590
01:18:13,730 --> 01:18:16,983
Let me do this, Aki. Trust me.

591
01:18:37,587 --> 01:18:38,714
I love you.

592
01:20:28,240 --> 01:20:30,200
Oh, it's warm.
