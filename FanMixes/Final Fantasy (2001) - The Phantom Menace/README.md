# Final Fantasy - The Phantom Menace
Final Fantasy The Spirits Within (2001) - Phantom Menace Edition

## Description
I was looking forward to this movie when it came out, as I imagine many people in Japan were as well. I have yet to meet anyone who didn't
agree that much of the acting by Baldwin and Buscemi was distracting, 
nevertheless director Hironobu Sakaguchi insisted that he would not change one scene and so far no edits of this movie have ever come out.
To make things worse, the Blu-Ray edition of the Japan Release (Spiritual Edition) was never released. This edit includes the rare dvd Japaneese
audio from the 2002 Spiritual Edition as a 2nd audio channel. 

## Changes
In this cut, all distracting or poorly acted scenes have been removed. 
The rare japaneese track is included as a 2nd audio option. 
The Final Fantasy remix "A Temple of Chaos" By Tim Sheehy was added.
The credits song Spirit Dreams Inside was replaced with the Final Fantasy IV remix "Hymn to the Crystals" by RebeccaETripp.
The title scene was moved from the first scene to after the intro sequence, since this is more traditional for Final Fantasy stories.
