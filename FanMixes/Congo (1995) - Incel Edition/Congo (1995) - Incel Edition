# Congo - Incel Edition

## Changes
In this cut, much of the irritating (incel-ish) dialog by Dr. Elliot was removed along with some screaming scenes by Travis and Captain Wanta.
Some gore was cut or reduced.
A major plot hole was resolved by moving forward an earlier scene where the group encounters Bob Driscoll in the forest nearly dead.
In the original cut, the group then travels for what looks like days across mountains and through forests to reach the location Driscoll apparently staggared out of. 
In this cut, they encounter Discoll right outside the camp site where he was attacked. 
I think the original editors moved the scene back in order to wake up the audience during some calmer sequences.
