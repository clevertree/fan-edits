1
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:52,005
<i>Dr. Ross, we've got 
satellite from the Congo.</i>

2
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:56,050
- What did he say, Rudy? 
- I can't repeat it here.

3
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,428
- It's Charles. 
- It's Charles.

4
00:02:59,679 --> 00:03:01,764
- It won't work. 
- He changed the code?

5
00:03:01,931 --> 00:03:04,267
The old man's got me changing it 
every three hours.

6
00:03:04,434 --> 00:03:09,022
- Rudy, Rudy, Rudy, Rudy. 
- Very inventive.

7
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,108
Just in time. 
We should have a visual momentarily.

8
00:03:12,275 --> 00:03:14,736
- They said they found it. 
- You're kidding.

9
00:03:14,903 --> 00:03:19,365
Seven volcanoes, and he picks the right 
one. His luck's finally changed.

10
00:03:21,075 --> 00:03:24,370
- Karen. 
- I read you, Charles. And I see you.

11
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:27,415
<i>Well, eureka and all that. 
I found the bloody thing.</i>

12
00:03:28,875 --> 00:03:31,419
- What was that? 
- The <i>usual.</i>

13
00:03:31,586 --> 00:03:33,504
<i>This whole place does the shimmy.</i>

14
00:03:33,671 --> 00:03:36,507
<i>- How's the volcano? 
- Acting very much like</i> a <i>volcano...</i>

15
00:03:36,674 --> 00:03:38,343
<i>thank you very much.</i>

16
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:41,596
<i>They tell me it's fine, 
but I wouldn't build condominiums.</i>

17
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:43,973
Charles, did you really find it?

18
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:49,312
<i>Chemically flawless, 
blue diamond alluvia.</i>

19
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:54,275
<i>Johnny-on-the-spot phasic laser.</i>

20
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,779
<i>This will look kind of raw 
without a real diamond.</i>

21
00:04:08,414 --> 00:04:10,875
<i>Would you say that test 
came back positive?</i>

22
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:13,378
Oh, my God.

23
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:18,216
<i>We found the sand in a mineral stream. 
Jeffrey's searching for the source.</i>

24
00:04:18,383 --> 00:04:22,720
<i>- I'll get Travis. 
- Wait. Jeffrey should share the glory.</i>

25
00:04:22,887 --> 00:04:25,932
<i>- Let's link up again in, uh, one hour. 
- Great.</i>

26
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,268
- See you <i>in</i> an <i>hour.</i> 
- Give me your coordinates.

27
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,938
Char...? Charles...?

28
00:04:36,609 --> 00:04:39,988
- Jeffrey. 
- Charlie, over here.

29
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:46,244
Charlie, I think this 
may be really something.

30
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:49,080
- We haven't got much time. 
<i>- I'll</i> show you.

31
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:52,625
Jump in.

32
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:57,005
- What? 
<i>- I'll</i> go first.

33
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,137
I Jeffrey!

34
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,405
I Jeffrey!

35
00:05:26,784 --> 00:05:29,370
- What is this? 
- Come on.

36
00:05:30,747 --> 00:05:35,168
From below it just looks like jungle, 
but it's not just jungle. See?

37
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,253
Jesus Christ.

38
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:42,508
This is a big deal. 
This is a big find.

39
00:05:42,675 --> 00:05:48,681
I can't believe it's just sitting here. 
All these centuries, waiting for lucky us.

40
00:05:53,728 --> 00:05:57,565
Listen, I raised Houston, 
they're getting the old man.

41
00:05:58,149 --> 00:06:00,610
Come on camera and share the glory.

42
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:04,989
- We'll have to get another team here. 
- All right. Let me grab my bag.

43
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:21,172
- Perfect, you say? A flawless diamond? 
- He found it. He was right.

44
00:06:21,339 --> 00:06:23,049
With the right laser and diamonds...

45
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:25,885
we can dominate 
the communications industry over night.

46
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:27,178
Has he found the source?

47
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:31,557
Charles says a laser with a diamond 
like that can punch a hole in the moon.

48
00:06:31,724 --> 00:06:33,643
Shh. Don't say any more out here.

49
00:06:34,435 --> 00:06:35,978
- Where is he? 
- I don't know.

50
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:39,148
- He should have transmitted 10 minutes ago. 
- Ugh.

51
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:41,109
- Activate the remote. 
- Yes, sir.

52
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:53,162
- I guess he's still looking for Jeffrey. 
- Hmm. Pan the camera.

53
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:01,796
What in God's name...?

54
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:13,433
Lock your remote. Back scan. 
Give me thermal readout.

55
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:20,690
- I can see seven dead people. 
- What's that sound?

56
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,709
- I didn't see him. Charles! 
- What?

57
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,213
<i>- I'll</i> get help. 
- You can't get out. I had the code changed.

58
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,591
Well, what is it?

59
00:07:47,133 --> 00:07:48,426
Rudy?

60
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,012
- Sir? 
- Use the fire extinguisher on that.

61
00:07:57,393 --> 00:08:02,023
- No one knows this happened but us. 
- Families have to be be notified. Your wife.

62
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,194
We don't know he's dead. 
If it's reported, they'll close the border.

63
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,821
- What was that thing? 
- Uh, baboon.

64
00:08:08,988 --> 00:08:13,326
- I thought it was a gorilla, but I've never... 
- Gorillas didn't kill. Gorillas don't do that.

65
00:08:13,701 --> 00:08:17,622
- It could have been locals, a rival company. 
- Not another paranoid fantasy.

66
00:08:17,788 --> 00:08:20,082
I need those diamonds, Dr. Ross!

67
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,543
- Are you for real? 
- It's the future.

68
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:28,716
- Most believe children are the future. 
- 40,000 people, they all depend on me.

69
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,719
This satellite is our cash cow.

70
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:37,183
In three years it'll be obsolete. I need 
a new cash machine. This diamond's it!

71
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:42,563
- Charles knew it. That's why he went. 
- He went into the Congo to please you.

72
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:46,317
- I know you had feelings for him. 
- I almost married him.

73
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,527
Listen to me, talking like he's...

74
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,404
You have to go down there, Dr. Ross.

75
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:53,908
You're good in the field. You were 
good in Panama. Once you're local...

76
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,036
that laser's power pack 
should give off a readable signal.

77
00:08:57,161 --> 00:09:00,331
Find some expedition that's already going. 
Take it over.

78
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,916
What are you talking about?

79
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,962
There's no time! Once we let out what's 
happened, Zaire will shut the border.

80
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,422
- By the time the investigation's... 
- Are you human?

81
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:12,677
I'll be human later. Hire people 
when you get there. Good people.

82
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:14,512
Never mind, I'll have some waiting.

83
00:09:14,887 --> 00:09:17,765
- Find out what happened to Charles. 
- Tell me you love your son.

84
00:09:17,932 --> 00:09:20,059
- I do. 
- And that's why you're sending me.

85
00:09:20,226 --> 00:09:22,144
It is.

86
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:28,109
All right. But if I have one moment when 
I think otherwise, I'll make you sorry.

87
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:29,819
That's a promise.

88
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:40,579
<i>Oakland's number one classic station...</i>

89
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:42,957
<i>taking you back in time, all the time.</i>

90
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,042
<i>There's 
a crazy little shack</i>

91
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:51,048
Wow. Isn't that beautiful? 
What's Amy's favorite color?

92
00:09:51,215 --> 00:09:57,179
Green, that's right. 
How green was my valley... Drop that!

93
00:09:57,346 --> 00:10:01,434
Good. Pretty. So pretty.

94
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:06,856
No, Amy, on the paper. Yeah, okay, good.

95
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,441
Amy, get some more paint.

96
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:13,863
Good. That's green.

97
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:17,825
No, Amy, on the paper. 
On... On the paper.

98
00:10:19,577 --> 00:10:23,039
Amy! Hey, you!

99
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:28,210
- How did she sleep? 
- Great night.

100
00:10:28,377 --> 00:10:30,171
- No nightmares? 
- Not a one.

101
00:10:30,338 --> 00:10:31,964
Good girl.

102
00:10:32,131 --> 00:10:33,966
That's my Amy.

103
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:39,263
Richard, you better clean her up. 
It's showtime.

104
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:42,892
When we started out, it was so simple.

105
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:47,438
Communication is what separated 
human from animal. Speech.

106
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:51,692
And for those humans who had 
am impairment that inhibited speech...

107
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:54,528
sign language. An alphabet in gestures.

108
00:10:54,695 --> 00:10:58,074
Words in motion. Then came virtual reality.

109
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:03,954
Sensors worn like clothing could read 
and replicate the body's movements.

110
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:10,836
Arliss Wender at MIT was the first to 
apply this technology to sign language.

111
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,883
<i>Our subject, William, 
was born without the organs of speech.</i>

112
00:11:16,050 --> 00:11:17,968
<i>Isn't that right, William?</i>

113
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:23,182
<i>That is absolutely right.</i>

114
00:11:28,562 --> 00:11:34,193
<i>This is the first time 
I have ever heard my own voice.</i>

115
00:11:38,197 --> 00:11:42,702
Lights, please. 
It's hard to get grants for what I do.

116
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:49,375
Most people just don't believe it. 
They think it's a parlor trick. A gag.

117
00:11:49,542 --> 00:11:51,669
But it's no gag, ladies and gentlemen.

118
00:11:51,836 --> 00:11:54,338
With this new technology, 
I can demonstrate it...

119
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:58,592
in a way it has never been possible 
to demonstrate it before.

120
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,803
Animals can talk.

121
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:05,141
Amy, could you come down 
here please?

122
00:12:19,321 --> 00:12:22,825
Hello, Amy. Thank you for the flowers.

123
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:25,369
<i>Peter. Hello, Peter.</i>

124
00:12:25,536 --> 00:12:26,829
Wow.

125
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:32,001
Amy, how old are you?

126
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:37,590
<i>Amy 7. Amy good gorilla.</i>

127
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:40,217
<i>- Amy pretty. 
</i>

128
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:43,429
Amy, look at me.

129
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:48,976
- Amy mother. 
- That's right. That's your baby.

130
00:12:49,143 --> 00:12:53,439
<i>- Amy wants lunch.</i> 
- Okay.

131
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:59,028
- What do you think, Mrs. Romy? 
- It's spooky. Very spooky.

132
00:12:59,195 --> 00:13:04,200
Amy's above average intelligence 
for a gorilla, but she's not a freak.

133
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,537
What she has learned, 
other gorillas have learned and can learn.

134
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,499
But that takes money, of course. 
Isn't that right, Amy?

135
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:32,895
Amy, calm down. Easy.

136
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:36,357
Hey, hey, hey! Shh, shh. 
It's okay. You're all right.

137
00:13:38,317 --> 00:13:44,281
- You've got her sedated. She'll be fine. 
- She's not gonna be fine. Nightmares again.

138
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:49,495
It's happened before. Gorillas in captivity 
degenerating mentally, having to be destroyed.

139
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:53,040
When she did these paintings 
she got better. Why?

140
00:13:56,126 --> 00:14:01,840
Hey, hey... 
What's this room starting to look like?

141
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,054
- The Jungle, she's been painting the jungle! 
- I don't know, Peter.

142
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,347
She wants to go home.

143
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:14,353
Peter, you did a great job. You taught a 
gorilla to talk, to paint, for gosh sakes.

144
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:18,440
When it comes to Amy, you can get a grant 
for anything except setting her free.

145
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,235
How about this. I taught her, 
now she can teach them.

146
00:14:21,402 --> 00:14:22,987
- Who? 
- The mountain gorillas.

147
00:14:23,153 --> 00:14:26,282
We can translate 
what other animals are saying.

148
00:14:26,407 --> 00:14:29,535
Oh, please. Making you Dr. Doolittle?

149
00:14:29,702 --> 00:14:34,498
There isn't a foundation in motion that would 
fund an expedition with that objective.

150
00:14:34,665 --> 00:14:36,709
I will pay.

151
00:14:37,167 --> 00:14:41,463
- I will pay for Amy to go home. 
- And who are you?

152
00:14:42,172 --> 00:14:47,303
Herkermer Homolka. Formerly of Romania. 
Free now of the chains of Ceaucescu.

153
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:50,681
Traveling the world, doing good.

154
00:14:53,892 --> 00:14:56,228
- A Romanian philanthropist? 
- Herkermer Homolka.

155
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,189
- Something's voodoo. 
- Don't look a gift horse in the mouth.

156
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:02,818
I don't think it's penetrating. 
We're taking Amy home. Get packed.

157
00:15:04,361 --> 00:15:08,741
Do you know where we're going? 
Amy, where are we going?

158
00:15:08,907 --> 00:15:12,536
- Jungle. <i>Me</i> jungle. 
- She's really excited.

159
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:16,457
- Are you excited? 
- Me? I'm terrified.

160
00:15:16,624 --> 00:15:20,419
- Jungle. 
- Safari? I don't even like picnics. Nice glasses.

161
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,713
<i>
Jungle. Me jungle.</i>

162
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:27,301
<i>- That's right. Jungle. Home. 
- Tickle me. Tickle me.</i>

163
00:15:28,636 --> 00:15:30,429
Come on, time to go.

164
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:42,524
Someone looking for me?

165
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:48,447
Herkermer Homolka, hello. 
Uh, the transport.

166
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,032
Oh, yeah. Um...

167
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,911
- ls there a problem? 
- Not unless there's a problem.

168
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:03,921
Are you excited, sweetheart? That's a 
camera. Be careful, it's expensive.

169
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:07,049
I think she's got a real eye.

170
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:11,929
- Karen Ross. Professor Karen Ross. 
- Professor Peter Elliot.

171
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,472
- Doctor. 
- Doctor.

172
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:16,266
Have you got my faxes, 
Fed Exes and phone calls?

173
00:16:16,433 --> 00:16:18,560
- I'm sorry, you're the one. 
- Yes, I'm the one.

174
00:16:18,686 --> 00:16:20,729
We've put together a hasty expedition.

175
00:16:20,896 --> 00:16:23,065
To the Congo, with a talking gorilla.

176
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:27,111
- Jungle me. Jungle. <i>Tickle</i> Amy. 
- That's right, jungle. Just a minute, Amy.

177
00:16:27,277 --> 00:16:30,989
- I'm sorry... I'm afraid that's impossible. 
- I need to join up with you.

178
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:32,616
- Excuse me. 
- Yeah?

179
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:35,953
- I have all the visas. 
- Go ahead and load this stuff on the plane.

180
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,622
- We're taking this stuff off the plane. 
- Off the plane?

181
00:16:38,789 --> 00:16:42,292
- I can pay part of the cost. 
- Why take stuff off the plane?

182
00:16:42,459 --> 00:16:46,588
- I'm sorry, we don't need any money. 
- You're flying way under capacity.

183
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:48,298
You can easily find room for me.

184
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:52,177
- It's not a matter of that. It's Amy. 
<i>- Ugly</i> woman.

185
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:54,555
- The gorilla? 
- She gets jealous very easily.

186
00:16:54,722 --> 00:16:57,057
Somebody tell me 
why you're unloading the plane.

187
00:16:57,224 --> 00:16:59,727
- Talk to the operations guy. 
- Can't you tell me?

188
00:16:59,893 --> 00:17:01,895
- No. 
- I've gotta get on this plane.

189
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:06,108
I've got to be listed with your manifest, 
or my visas are worthless. Name your price.

190
00:17:06,275 --> 00:17:09,403
I don't have a price. I'm not a pound 
of sugar, I'm a primatologist.

191
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:12,072
Don't be hasty, Dr. Elliot.

192
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,659
Herkermer Homolka, 
formerly of Romania.

193
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:18,620
- Dr. Karen Ross. 
- There seems to be some glitch.

194
00:17:18,787 --> 00:17:21,540
- They're unloading the plane. 
- Yes.

195
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:27,296
Unfortunately there has been 
a slight interruption in my credit flow.

196
00:17:27,463 --> 00:17:31,091
- I am unable to pay for the fuel. 
- I'll pay for the fuel.

197
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:35,679
<i>- I'll</i> pay for it. How much is the fuel? 
- Fifty-six thousand dollars.

198
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:37,181
Fifty-six thousand?

199
00:17:38,766 --> 00:17:40,350
What are you smiling about?

200
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:42,728
You need me, Dr. Elliot.

201
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:51,862
<i>Taxi to</i> 
runway, three-one <i>left.</i>

202
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:54,448
<i>This is your captain speaking.</i>

203
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:56,658
<i>- Hey. 
- We've been cleared for take-off.</i>

204
00:17:56,825 --> 00:18:00,704
<i>Please make sure that your seat belts 
are fastened and that all carry-on...</i>

205
00:18:00,871 --> 00:18:04,458
We're returning her to the jungle 
from whence she came.

206
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,627
From the look of it, not a moment too soon.

207
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:11,632
That's it. Good girl. Here's an egg.

208
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:13,967
Unh.

209
00:18:14,134 --> 00:18:17,304
We do not throw things. 
- ls that animal dangerous?

210
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,474
Humans are dangerous, 
gorillas are very gentle.

211
00:18:25,854 --> 00:18:27,064
It's okay, Amy.

212
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:29,650
<i>Where ground?</i>

213
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:31,985
- Where ground? 
- It's fine. We're flying.

214
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:37,282
- We're going to the jungle. 
- Amy want <i>green</i> drop <i>drink.</i>

215
00:18:37,449 --> 00:18:41,912
<i>- No. 
- Amy want green drop drink.</i>

216
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:43,580
All right, all right.

217
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:47,584
You'd swear they were married.

218
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:53,715
The notion of the "killer ape" may be politically 
incorrect, but that's not to say it's untrue.

219
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:55,592
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

220
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,430
Cliches usually contain some 
element of truth.

221
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:11,149
- Are you serving that ape a martini? 
- She's allowed one. It'll calm her down.

222
00:19:13,068 --> 00:19:16,822
In my life I have heard 
many a bizarre story.

223
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:22,578
Many a bizarre story 
containing bizarre truth.

224
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:51,481
- There you go. Watch your step. 
- Dr. Ross!

225
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,361
- Dr. Ross! 
- Hello?

226
00:19:56,528 --> 00:20:02,201
Eddie Ventro. Mr Travis asked me 
to meet your plane, set up your expedition.

227
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:06,538
- Her expedition? She's just along for the ride. 
- Whatever. Be an asshole.

228
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:11,335
- Who is this guy? 
- Eddie Ventro, transportation and equipment.

229
00:20:11,501 --> 00:20:15,964
But I don't supply assholes with new 
personalities. Wanna see your new plane?

230
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:18,425
Let's go! Hold on.

231
00:20:21,762 --> 00:20:23,764
- Wanna sell that gorilla? 
- No.

232
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,474
- Worth a lot of money. 
- How much?

233
00:20:25,641 --> 00:20:28,101
- Mr. Homolka, I can't believe you. 
- I'm just curious.

234
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,479
Twenty, twenty-five grand for a female.

235
00:20:31,313 --> 00:20:36,193
- Amy want to go home. Go home. 
- I'm taking you home,</i> Amy.

236
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:42,115
Whoa, a talking gorilla! I feel the money hairs 
on the back of my neck going woo, woo, woo.

237
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:46,912
Mr. Travis told me to load you up. The 
works. You know how to use all this stuff?

238
00:20:47,079 --> 00:20:49,289
- I'll get by. 
- You really need a balloon?

239
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:51,124
No, I don't. Let me see that.

240
00:20:52,834 --> 00:20:55,212
- Who are they? 
- Hi, fellas!

241
00:20:55,837 --> 00:20:59,591
Fuck if I know. Don't ask. 
We're on our third government in two years.

242
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:02,552
- So are you our guide? 
- No, I stay at the airport.

243
00:21:02,719 --> 00:21:04,179
Supposing you got Monroe Kelly.

244
00:21:04,346 --> 00:21:07,683
- Is he good? 
- He's very good. He's also very late.

245
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,393
Whoa.

246
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,853
- Holy shit, now what? 
- What was that?

247
00:21:11,979 --> 00:21:15,023
Haven't got a clue. I feel like 
this airport's just gone to shit.

248
00:21:24,366 --> 00:21:28,787
- All right, give me your passports. 
- We already arranged for a guide.

249
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:30,831
- Robertson Reynolds. 
- Yeah, I fired him.

250
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:32,791
- You what? 
- Reynolds is a bird-watcher.

251
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:35,293
- I hired Robertson Reynolds. 
- You would.

252
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:38,964
You have any idea what's going on 
in the Congo as of this morning?

253
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,676
The Kigani have had it with Zaire 
and they're eating people.

254
00:21:42,843 --> 00:21:46,263
You go in with Reynolds, you're coming out 
somebody's bowel movement.

255
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:49,599
There you go. Now wasn't that 
easier than going through customs?

256
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,810
Monroe.

257
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,771
- Guess what? 
- What?

258
00:21:54,896 --> 00:21:57,190
- We need to switch airports. 
- Oh, shit, why?

259
00:21:57,357 --> 00:21:58,817
Bomb in the president's car.

260
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:01,320
It was the president's car? 
Did they get him?

261
00:22:01,486 --> 00:22:04,197
That's the bad news. No, they didn't.

262
00:22:04,364 --> 00:22:06,950
- I hope you folks have lots of money. 
- We do.

263
00:22:15,959 --> 00:22:19,588
Thank you. Now run away. 
Oh, come on, man, run away.

264
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:22,466
- Get in the back. 
- What about equipment?

265
00:22:22,632 --> 00:22:24,718
Leave it to Eddie. I would hurry, really.

266
00:22:24,885 --> 00:22:26,553
- Is this normal? 
- Get in the truck.

267
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:29,056
- You're on your own, Eddie. 
- Yeah, how I like it.

268
00:22:31,558 --> 00:22:34,269
- Where do you want me to set you up? 
- Get a DC-3.

269
00:22:34,436 --> 00:22:38,023
A grass strip south of Kegoma. Get it 
stripped. Keep this from the company.

270
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,903
First the Kigani in Zaire, now this godfather 
stuff. Not a good day to be in Africa.

271
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,447
- Lower the flaps. 
- So long, good luck!

272
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:47,449
Now sit down.

273
00:23:08,553 --> 00:23:11,098
I'm getting out of here. Unh!

274
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:23,777
- What's going on? 
- Are we safe?

275
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,989
It's all right, just bumpy. 
Just a few bumps.

276
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,163
Amy, leave that man alone.

277
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:43,130
Amy, don't inhale.

278
00:23:45,173 --> 00:23:47,259
- Karen Ross? 
- That's me.

279
00:23:48,260 --> 00:23:51,221
Monroe Kelly. 
I'm your great white hunter for this trip.

280
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:56,226
- Though I happen to be black. 
- How bad is this news for us?

281
00:23:56,393 --> 00:24:01,106
Whenever the leadership of one of these little 
Central African countries comes into question...

282
00:24:01,273 --> 00:24:02,941
they tend to murder everybody.

283
00:24:03,108 --> 00:24:05,110
- Oh, my God! 
- Not really?

284
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:07,571
They live for the opportunity 
to settle scores.

285
00:24:07,737 --> 00:24:12,242
And they've got a lot of scores to settle. 
It's like what's going on in the Congo.

286
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:15,704
- Things are pretty bad in the Congo. 
- We heard.

287
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:18,582
The Kigani are pissed off.

288
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:24,004
Can't blame them. The 20th century sucks. 
Maybe the 21st will be better.

289
00:24:24,171 --> 00:24:26,965
- You some kind of criminal, aren't you? 
- Aren't we all?

290
00:24:27,132 --> 00:24:29,718
No. I'm not a criminal, I'm a scientist.

291
00:24:29,885 --> 00:24:31,595
Scientist?

292
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:35,974
I run a few guns, 
you sons of bitches ruin the world.

293
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:40,395
I don't think it's a good idea to have 
further involvement with these people.

294
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:42,772
What would you suggest we do, Dr. Elliot?

295
00:24:43,398 --> 00:24:46,485
As soon as we can, 
we should go our own way.

296
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:49,905
- Ugh. 
- Don't I know you?

297
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,743
Perhaps. I travel a great deal.

298
00:24:55,452 --> 00:24:58,330
- What are you doing with that gorilla? 
- Taking her home.

299
00:24:58,455 --> 00:25:00,957
She was caught 
in the Virunga region of the Congo.

300
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:04,878
You're going to try and take her back 
to the farm now that she's seen Paris?

301
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:10,175
- And this is your cover? 
- Yes.

302
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,928
Pretty good. Or, it would have been.

303
00:25:13,094 --> 00:25:17,349
- I'm nobody's cover. Cover for what? 
- You find yourself in the middle of something.

304
00:25:17,515 --> 00:25:20,393
- Cover for what? 
- I don't know, and she won't tell you.

305
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:23,146
But the kind of money 
her company is throwing around?

306
00:25:23,313 --> 00:25:26,107
They don't spend that for any gorilla.

307
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:31,947
Relax. You're in better hands 
than you should be.

308
00:26:14,114 --> 00:26:17,784
- Monroe. 
- Captain Wanta.

309
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:23,123
How are you? 
Miss Ross, such a pleasure.

310
00:26:25,834 --> 00:26:28,962
Have some, uh, coffee and cake.

311
00:26:33,341 --> 00:26:37,262
You have our visas. Our manifest. 
This is a legitimate scientific mission.

312
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:39,389
You have no right to detain us.

313
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,851
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

314
00:26:43,810 --> 00:26:47,105
So says my computer, Miss Ross.

315
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,363
Ah. You used to work for the CIA. 
And now you're TraviCom.

316
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:59,367
- TraviCom pays better than the CIA? 
- You have a big mouth.

317
00:26:59,534 --> 00:27:03,455
Everybody says that about me. 
What can I do?

318
00:27:04,622 --> 00:27:07,125
Monroe, you have 
the worst timing in the world.

319
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:08,418
Tell me about it.

320
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:11,087
They blew up the president's Mercedes, 
did you know?

321
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:15,633
It's a big plot. Our country will 
be in shit for at least a year.

322
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:18,053
- Captain, I need that truck. 
- You need the truck.

323
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:21,222
You also need ten good men to the border.

324
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:32,442
More.

325
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,500
Mr. Homolka?

326
00:27:49,834 --> 00:27:51,461
Mm.

327
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,171
Stop eating my sesame cake.

328
00:27:54,881 --> 00:27:56,341
Mm.

329
00:27:57,967 --> 00:28:01,596
What are you doing in my country, 
you bag of shit?

330
00:28:01,763 --> 00:28:06,309
Captain, please. 
I only wish to explore and discover.

331
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:12,607
This fellow is a big bag of shit.

332
00:28:12,774 --> 00:28:18,655
Shake this rat from off your neck. He owes 
money to everybody everywhere he goes.

333
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:21,199
I will ask you to wait outside, Mr. 
Homolka.

334
00:28:26,579 --> 00:28:30,667
You know, it's the gorilla that's going 
to get you across the border safely.

335
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:36,464
Everybody's so afraid of being seen in an 
American movie being cruel to a gorilla.

336
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:41,636
This is the crazy world we live in. 
Okay, you can go.

337
00:28:43,805 --> 00:28:47,559
Hit the road, as they say. 
And have a nice day.

338
00:29:04,951 --> 00:29:06,703
- You all right? 
- Yeah.

339
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:08,079
Admit it, you're glad to see me.

340
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,423
- Kahega! 
- Ah, Monroe!

341
00:30:03,343 --> 00:30:05,345
Kikuyu tribesman, very nice guy.

342
00:30:05,470 --> 00:30:08,139
- Are we in Zaire? 
- Tanzania.

343
00:30:26,616 --> 00:30:31,162
Stay close to me. Amy. Amy, come on.

344
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:45,093
- Somehow, I think this is at my expense. 
- You're right.

345
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:52,892
When do you think we will 
get to the rainforest?

346
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:56,104
- Herkermer Homolka, right? 
- Yes. Hi, hello.

347
00:30:56,271 --> 00:30:59,065
You're not looking for 
Solomon's city again, are you?

348
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:01,150
What are you talking about?

349
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:03,903
Mr. Homolka was part of 
a disastrous expedition...

350
00:31:04,028 --> 00:31:06,656
- about, what, five years ago? 
- I would prefer you...

351
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,535
They were looking for a city called Zinj. 
Unfortunately, it doesn't exist.

352
00:31:10,702 --> 00:31:12,787
- It does exist! 
- Fine.

353
00:31:12,912 --> 00:31:15,748
Three members of his safari 
died from exposure.

354
00:31:15,915 --> 00:31:20,253
- A fourth was shot by we don't know who. 
- It was an appalling suicide.

355
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:24,215
We won't quibble. And Mr. Homolka 
had to be carried out of the jungle...

356
00:31:24,382 --> 00:31:25,967
by, as I remember it, me.

357
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,428
I knew he wasn't a Romanian philanthropist.

358
00:31:28,595 --> 00:31:33,308
Oh, he's Romanian. And he has 
done good, but mostly for Mr. Homolka.

359
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:43,443
- What's all this stuff? 
- Courtesy of Eddie Ventro.

360
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:44,944
Eddie! What happened?

361
00:31:45,111 --> 00:31:50,033
Ugh. A customs guy hit me with a can 
of peanut oil for stamping visas.

362
00:31:50,199 --> 00:31:52,160
I'm never going back to that country, man.

363
00:31:52,327 --> 00:31:54,454
- Those people have permanently wigged out. 
- Ha, ha.

364
00:31:54,621 --> 00:31:56,122
- Dr. Ross. 
- Hi.

365
00:31:56,289 --> 00:32:01,419
Equipment list. You got everything but the 
balloon and the home entertainment center.

366
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:04,505
- Ah. Your boss says "Call me." 
- Okay.

367
00:32:04,672 --> 00:32:08,593
You got 11 good guys, significant 
firepower, significant technology.

368
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:11,262
More than that 
I don't think you're gonna need. Agree?

369
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,722
- I agree. 
- Good luck.

370
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:15,016
- Bye, Eddie. 
- Bye, Monroe.

371
00:32:39,332 --> 00:32:43,127
- May I? 
- There's one thing I don't understand, Monroe.

372
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,504
What's that, Dr. Elliot?

373
00:32:44,671 --> 00:32:46,381
If the border to Zaire is shut...

374
00:32:46,547 --> 00:32:49,384
- how do we get across? 
- Luck.

375
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:13,032
What's going on?

376
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,535
What the hell is that?

377
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:21,958
Shit. I thought we'd get farther. 
I'd put her out now.

378
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,794
- Oh, you would? Who's firing on us? 
- Kahega!

379
00:33:24,961 --> 00:33:27,755
We crossed the border into Zaire. 
We're violating airspace.

380
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,424
- She likes bananas? 
- Sure.

381
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,760
Here, eat this, darling. 
She's going to feel great.

382
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,973
- What do you mean? 
- Something to keep her calm. Gorilla Prozac.

383
00:33:38,850 --> 00:33:40,685
- Can we make it to Bondo? 
- I don't know!

384
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,312
That last one was a heat-seeker. 
We're done.

385
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:59,328
- What are you doing? 
- Step aside, please.

386
00:34:21,058 --> 00:34:22,894
<i>Hey-</i>

387
00:34:46,292 --> 00:34:48,377
Miss Ross. Here.

388
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:53,883
- Why are they putting on parachutes? 
- Figure it out.

389
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:56,177
- Take it. 
- Oh, no!

390
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:12,735
- This isn't gonna work. 
- Yes it is. I'll take Amy.

391
00:35:13,778 --> 00:35:16,989
- She might get hurt. I can't risk it. 
- You know how to fly this plane?

392
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:19,242
- No. 
- The pilot and co-pilot are gone.

393
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:21,285
So, what are you going to do?

394
00:35:22,912 --> 00:35:24,747
Ugh.

395
00:35:25,206 --> 00:35:26,958
Go! Go, go, go!

396
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:39,846
Push me, please.

397
00:35:42,098 --> 00:35:43,933
Harder, please.

398
00:36:05,371 --> 00:36:07,707
You want me to push you too?

399
00:36:11,794 --> 00:36:14,255
See you down there.

400
00:36:16,299 --> 00:36:18,384
Oh!

401
00:37:22,281 --> 00:37:24,784
- Where's Amy? 
- Now she's asleep.

402
00:37:24,951 --> 00:37:28,079
Over there. On the way down, 
she decided to wake up.

403
00:37:28,245 --> 00:37:32,959
- And that little lady has some set of teeth. 
- I'm sorry, but we have to call this off.

404
00:37:33,125 --> 00:37:34,961
- I beg your pardon? 
- I'm in over my head.

405
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:37,797
- I'm not James Bond. 
- Don't worry, I'll take care of you.

406
00:37:37,964 --> 00:37:40,258
I don't want you to take care of me.

407
00:37:40,967 --> 00:37:45,054
Fine. I'm taking a safari 
into the Virunga region of the Congo.

408
00:37:45,179 --> 00:37:48,432
If you don't want to go, just go wherever.

409
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:53,229
But you should know this is a dangerous 
place, and people die here very easily.

410
00:37:54,105 --> 00:37:56,232
Now, excuse me.

411
00:38:04,532 --> 00:38:05,783
Amy?

412
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:12,957
Amy? Amy!

413
00:38:14,041 --> 00:38:15,876
Amy?

414
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:26,804
Such an extraordinary animal.

415
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:31,726
Those paintings. Do you think she was 
drawing something she saw in life?

416
00:38:31,892 --> 00:38:33,227
Or in a dream, maybe?

417
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:37,606
- I think she was drawing a jungle, home. 
- What about those oval shapes?

418
00:38:37,773 --> 00:38:41,777
- Just a shape she likes, something like that. 
- Perhaps.

419
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:45,614
- Video game? 
- It gives latitude and longitude.

420
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:50,786
- More than that, from the look of it. 
- Well, you know, it's a gadget. It has features.

421
00:38:50,953 --> 00:38:53,664
You're picking up a signal. 
Someone or something?

422
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:55,750
- A little bit Of both. 
- Ah.

423
00:38:55,916 --> 00:39:00,087
- So why did you quit the CIA? 
- I never worked for the CIA.

424
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:01,422
Of course you didn't.

425
00:39:01,589 --> 00:39:04,467
But if you had worked for the CIA, 
why would you quit?

426
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:07,053
Because they're a loveless bunch 
of sons of bitches.

427
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:10,014
- And you're not? 
- And I'm not.

428
00:39:10,139 --> 00:39:11,974
Glad to hear it.

429
00:39:18,898 --> 00:39:23,527
- Okay, here we go. 
- Ah. Fabulous equipment.

430
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:26,113
- Best of the best. 
- I have air-conditioning, too.

431
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:28,240
Air-conditioners?

432
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:32,203
- I suppose it is a bit much. 
- Shit, I'll take one.

433
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,625
Hey, Stop it!

434
00:39:42,755 --> 00:39:44,799
Mr. Homolka...

435
00:39:44,965 --> 00:39:50,638
- Please, call me Herkermer. 
- All right. You can call me Mr. Kelly.

436
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,977
- I wonder what she's about. 
- What do you mean?

437
00:39:57,144 --> 00:39:59,438
She's after something. 
You're after something.

438
00:39:59,605 --> 00:40:03,442
What you're after, I've got figured. 
But what she's after, I don't know.

439
00:40:03,609 --> 00:40:05,653
I'll get you! I'll get you!

440
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:11,575
I'm helping that young scientist 
return his ward to the wild.

441
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:15,955
He says the ape may be able to tell us 
the thoughts of the wild gorillas.

442
00:40:16,122 --> 00:40:17,832
Well I can tell you your thoughts.

443
00:40:17,081 --> 00:40:21,585
You're looking for King Solomon's 
diamonds. The lost city of Zinj.

444
00:40:24,463 --> 00:40:26,757
- I've given it up. 
- You'll never give it up.

445
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,760
The problem is, Herkermer, 
it doesn't exist.

446
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:34,890
Solomon must have gotten his diamonds 
from Cartiers, like everybody else.

447
00:40:39,562 --> 00:40:43,732
Ha-ha-ha. You like that, don't you? 
Ha-ha-ha.

448
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:48,571
Time for Madam Amy's vitamins.

449
00:40:55,077 --> 00:40:58,122
This is Karen Ross. 81452.

450
00:40:58,289 --> 00:41:03,586
That is KR81452. 
Houston, Travis, do you read?

451
00:41:04,336 --> 00:41:09,049
<i>Karen Ross, 81452. 
Houston, Travis, do you read?</i>

452
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:14,096
I read and see you, Dr. Ross. 
Congratulations on crossing the border.

453
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:18,058
<i>I'm picking up a signal 
from the laser's power pack.</i>

454
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,936
Excellent. Wherever the laser is, 
Charles should be too.

455
00:41:21,103 --> 00:41:25,524
Let's hope so. Tomorrow we enter the 
rainforest at the base of the volcanic range.

456
00:41:25,691 --> 00:41:30,779
<i>Good. Karen, I've had those images 
of that creature analyzed. Rudy.</i>

457
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,331
<i>What's W? 
- My primatologist tells me it's something new.</i>

458
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:42,708
<i>He doesn't know what, 
but it's gorilla-like.</i>

459
00:41:42,875 --> 00:41:44,752
Are you sufficiently armed?

460
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:47,713
- Do you have enough manpower? 
<i>- Yes.</i>

461
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:51,592
Good. The bad news is Geo-thermal. 
You've got to hurry.

462
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:55,638
That region in the Virungas is bad. 
Sometimes the volcanic activity...

463
00:41:55,804 --> 00:41:58,766
<i>is breaking out of the graph. 
The region's going to blow.</i>

464
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:01,519
<i>Could be a week, could be sooner. 
Dr. Ross...</i>

465
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:03,896
- What the hell...? 
- Watch out!

466
00:42:04,063 --> 00:42:07,524
No, dammit! Not again!

467
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,194
Oh. I'm terribly sorry.

468
00:42:13,739 --> 00:42:15,366
It's destroyed.

469
00:42:17,201 --> 00:42:19,912
It's completely destroyed.

470
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:31,942
It's Amy's medical supplies. 
They can't get wet.

471
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:59,511
Beautiful boats. 
Money's a wonderful thing.

472
00:43:59,678 --> 00:44:01,597
Give her the banana with the dope inside?

473
00:44:01,764 --> 00:44:05,225
Yes, he gave her the banana 
with the dope inside.

474
00:44:05,392 --> 00:44:08,604
I know. Shitty Peter. I know.

475
00:44:08,771 --> 00:44:11,065
Hey, what's this?

476
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:14,401
Oh.

477
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:17,363
All <i>the</i> leaves are brown

478
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:20,282
<i>And the sky is gray</i>

479
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:22,910
<i>I've been for a walk</i>

480
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:24,995
<i>On</i> a <i>winters day</i>

481
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:26,914
<i>On a winters day</i>

482
00:44:27,081 --> 00:44:30,626
<i>I'd be safe and warm</i>

483
00:44:30,793 --> 00:44:34,713
<i>If I was in L.A.</i>

484
00:44:34,838 --> 00:44:38,550
<i>- California dreaming 
- California dreaming</i>

485
00:44:38,717 --> 00:44:42,471
<i>On such a winters day</i>

486
00:44:42,638 --> 00:44:46,975
<i>Stopped into a church</i>

487
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,863
Watch out for the rock!

488
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,241
Whoa!

489
00:45:03,784 --> 00:45:05,327
Hang on!

490
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:29,226
- What is this Zinj, Mr. Homolka? 
- I don't know what you're talking about.

491
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,771
It's been believed that King Solomon 
had a diamond mine in the Congo...

492
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:34,398
in a city called Zinj.

493
00:45:34,815 --> 00:45:36,525
Diamonds?

494
00:45:39,611 --> 00:45:43,574
I suppose there's no point 
in playing stupid.

495
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:48,662
We shall arrive there together, 
we shall all be rich.

496
00:45:48,829 --> 00:45:51,623
That's fine with me. 
Except there's no Zinj.

497
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:54,960
Half the safaris that have gone in looking 
never made it back.

498
00:45:55,127 --> 00:45:56,920
The other half came back with nothing.

499
00:45:57,087 --> 00:46:01,759
Yes, but we have a trumping card 
that they did not have.

500
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:05,679
- We do? 
- We do. That gorilla...

501
00:46:06,221 --> 00:46:08,348
- knows where it is. 
- What?

502
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:10,184
The gorilla?

503
00:46:10,309 --> 00:46:14,605
As a young man, 
I found a book in Soviet Georgia.

504
00:46:14,772 --> 00:46:19,234
It contained a detailed drawing 
of the city of Zinj.

505
00:46:19,776 --> 00:46:23,280
The drawing contained 
a peculiar decoration.

506
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:26,241
An open eye.

507
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:30,120
Later, on safari, I found this.

508
00:46:34,333 --> 00:46:36,919
It's the same symbol. Now...

509
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,297
look at this.

510
00:46:42,799 --> 00:46:45,052
The gorilla drew this.

511
00:46:47,429 --> 00:46:52,309
It is the same image. It is the open eye.

512
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:58,023
That gorilla has seen the city of Zinj.

513
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:03,070
Have your laughing, and I will have mine.

514
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:11,787
Shit...

515
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:16,625
- What is it? 
- The signal stopped.

516
00:47:16,792 --> 00:47:21,296
- Does that mean...? 
- It just means the signal stopped.

517
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,174
I don't know what it means.

518
00:48:24,401 --> 00:48:26,069
No problem.

519
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,097
Oh, my God!

520
00:49:04,566 --> 00:49:06,693
- Shoot it! 
- Amy!

521
00:49:06,860 --> 00:49:10,364
- What is it? 
- Turn the boat around, quickly.

522
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:15,994
Agh! Aah!

523
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:19,206
Shoot it! Oh, my God!

524
00:49:20,999 --> 00:49:22,918
Turn the boat around!

525
00:49:27,089 --> 00:49:28,966
Head for shore!

526
00:49:45,482 --> 00:49:47,317
- How is he? 
- It's just a big cut.

527
00:49:47,484 --> 00:49:49,695
- I'll stitch it up, he'll be all right. 
- Oh, God.

528
00:49:51,238 --> 00:49:54,032
- What's that? 
- A plane.

529
00:49:54,991 --> 00:49:57,369
- Good luck to them. 
- Who are they?

530
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:01,665
I don't know, but the Zaire Air Force 
has got a piece of their ass.

531
00:50:06,086 --> 00:50:09,339
Pitch camp. Tomorrow, Mt. Mukenko.

532
00:50:28,984 --> 00:50:31,486
- She's getting excited. 
- Why, do you think?

533
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:35,323
Somewhere on the other side of this 
mountain is where Amy was born.

534
00:51:03,351 --> 00:51:05,562
Wow, it's beautiful.

535
00:51:07,355 --> 00:51:10,358
Is this your valley, Amy? 
It is, isn't it?

536
00:51:10,525 --> 00:51:13,570
It's home. That's your home.

537
00:51:15,781 --> 00:51:19,910
Pretty jungle, that's right.

538
00:51:25,540 --> 00:51:27,042
What's she doing?

539
00:51:27,209 --> 00:51:30,796
She wants to go to the place in her heart.

540
00:51:30,962 --> 00:51:36,718
- You mean the place in your heart, Herkermer. 
- You may call me Mr. Homolka.

541
00:51:38,220 --> 00:51:40,555
Come on, Amy, let's go.

542
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,518
- We've lost two porters. 
- Where'd they go?

543
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:48,104
- Ran away. 
- And they didn't invite me?

544
00:51:48,271 --> 00:51:51,858
You want your glove? All right, sit still.

545
00:51:55,445 --> 00:52:01,952
This, as they say, is a fork in the road. 
We could go left or we could go right.

546
00:52:02,118 --> 00:52:04,287
We go the wrong way, 
we lose two or three days.

547
00:52:04,454 --> 00:52:07,082
We must follow the gorilla. 
Where she leads.

548
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:10,544
- That would be left. 
- Best guess...

549
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,712
off my last coordinates was this way.

550
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:17,801
- That would be right. 
- Amy, Peter, <i>go</i> this way.

551
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:24,558
Well, I don't have her passion. 
I'll follow the gorilla.

552
00:52:31,815 --> 00:52:34,860
This doesn't seem 
like the right way to me.

553
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,346
Good Lord.

554
00:53:07,225 --> 00:53:10,979
- It's that plane we saw burning in 
the sky. - Who were they?

555
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:14,774
Travis, my boss, thought I wasn't gonna 
make it. He sent another expedition.

556
00:53:14,900 --> 00:53:19,029
Tried to push too far. Looks like a rocket 
got them. There's no point going in there.

557
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:25,160
- My God, what a waste of life. 
- We'd better keep moving.

558
00:54:24,886 --> 00:54:28,473
- Oh, shit! Somebody help me. 
- What is it?

559
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:31,643
There's something on my... 
Like, a creature, growth or something.

560
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:34,813
- Look. 
- Ah. That's a leech.

561
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:38,149
- Take it off. 
- It's your leech, you take it off.

562
00:54:38,316 --> 00:54:39,734
- Need some help? 
- No.

563
00:54:39,901 --> 00:54:42,153
- Here, burn it off with this. 
- Ha-ha-ha.

564
00:54:42,320 --> 00:54:43,738
- Ha, ha. 
- Ugh.

565
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:46,032
- Mm! 
- This is disgusting.

566
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:53,081
Here.

567
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:06,136
- Monroe? 
- Don't indicate you see them.

568
00:55:07,178 --> 00:55:12,517
Mizumu. The ghost tribe. 
There are probably 20 of them.

569
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:17,439
- I only see two. 
- Yes, that's how they are.

570
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:21,151
- Are they friendly? 
- They're sensitive. They're forest people.

571
00:55:31,536 --> 00:55:35,415
- Why are they laughing? 
- They asked who was in charge, I said I was.

572
00:55:35,582 --> 00:55:37,709
- What's so funny about that? 
- I'm black.

573
00:55:37,876 --> 00:55:39,919
I should have luggage on my head.

574
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:50,472
He says there's a dead white man...

575
00:55:50,638 --> 00:55:53,391
in this forest with a 
symbol on his clothes.

576
00:55:58,813 --> 00:56:01,608
He's dead? Did they say he's dead?

577
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:06,613
- What does "TC" mean? 
- TraviCom. The company I work for.

578
00:56:06,780 --> 00:56:08,948
They have several levels of "dead."

579
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:12,744
Someone's not dead 
until they're completely dead.

580
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:55,328
They haven't moved him. 
They believe his soul has left his body.

581
00:56:55,537 --> 00:56:58,957
If they move him, his soul will be lost, 
never finding his body again.

582
00:56:59,124 --> 00:57:01,918
They're calling to his soul, 
asking it to come back.

583
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:30,613
Where is the man?

584
00:57:44,878 --> 00:57:46,171
- It's not him. 
- Not who?

585
00:57:46,337 --> 00:57:48,756
It's Bob Driscoll. What happened to him?

586
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,301
Bob? Bob?

587
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,428
- Let's sit him up. 
- Who is this man?

588
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:57,724
My company sent an expedition to 
the Virungas. This man was with them.

589
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:00,185
Lay him over there.

590
00:58:00,351 --> 00:58:03,104
- What happened to him? 
- I don't know.

591
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:06,149
Bob?

592
00:58:36,554 --> 00:58:38,556
- He's dead. 
- God, no.

593
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:49,984
That region of the Congo is uninhabited.

594
00:58:50,151 --> 00:58:52,320
- Something inhabits it. 
- What did you see?

595
00:58:52,487 --> 00:58:55,198
Camp destroyed. People dead. 
A gray gorilla or something.

596
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:57,408
- No such thing as a gray gorilla. 
- I saw one.

597
00:58:57,575 --> 00:59:00,078
- That's hard to believe. 
- Two men are unaccounted for.

598
00:59:00,245 --> 00:59:02,747
Jeffrey Weems 
and Charles Travis, my fiancé.

599
00:59:02,914 --> 00:59:04,415
- My former fiancé. 
- Former?

600
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:06,042
We'd better get to him, then.

601
00:59:21,933 --> 00:59:23,935
- What the hell is that? 
- Perimeter alarm.

602
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,437
They had it around their camp.

603
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,649
But where's the camp, their equipment?

604
00:59:47,166 --> 00:59:51,921
I don't understand it. There had to be 
300 pounds of equipment.

605
00:59:52,088 --> 00:59:54,799
And the bodies. 
There's no sign of the bodies.

606
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:25,455
- It's a dead end? 
- Maybe, maybe not.

607
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:37,717
Yes. Bingo!

608
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:33,564
- Son of a bitch. 
- Jesus.

609
01:01:33,731 --> 01:01:35,691
What is this?

610
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:40,279
It is the city of Zinj...

611
01:01:42,490 --> 01:01:46,411
that I have looked for all my life.

612
01:01:51,958 --> 01:01:55,002
See, the eyes.

613
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:58,423
It is the same.

614
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:03,761
Kahega, guns up. Stay alert.

615
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:12,228
Come here, Amy. Stay with me.

616
01:04:03,339 --> 01:04:08,553
First they found the diamonds, 
Solomon's men.

617
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:13,683
A diamond mine of incredible bounty.

618
01:04:14,934 --> 01:04:21,190
Then they built the city around 
the mine, so that it should be protected.

619
01:04:21,732 --> 01:04:24,652
The savagery of the guards was legend.

620
01:04:24,819 --> 01:04:29,115
They instantly fell upon 
any thief, any transgressor.

621
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:33,411
The diamonds flowed 
to the kingdom of Solomon.

622
01:04:33,578 --> 01:04:35,705
What happened? Why did the city die?

623
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:38,124
- I don't know. 
- Maybe the mines ran dry.

624
01:04:38,291 --> 01:04:41,460
No! No, the diamonds are here!

625
01:04:41,627 --> 01:04:44,714
- Monroe, over here! 
- What is it?

626
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,595
On the step, by the hood.

627
01:04:50,761 --> 01:04:52,638
I found this.

628
01:04:59,604 --> 01:05:01,314
Don't go in there. I'll check it out.

629
01:05:01,480 --> 01:05:05,943
- Give me a gun and a flashlight. 
- Don't be so John Wayne, you could get killed.

630
01:05:07,570 --> 01:05:10,740
Now that I've said that, 
I'm not going in there alone, either.

631
01:05:10,906 --> 01:05:13,743
- I must go. 
- Let's all look.

632
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,453
I'll just stay out here with Amy.

633
01:05:15,620 --> 01:05:17,747
Not alone you won't. Kahega!

634
01:05:43,814 --> 01:05:46,609
Stay close together. Homolka...

635
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:58,037
- Homolka! 
- The same hieroglyphics, over and over.

636
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:03,209
- What do they mean? 
- Homolka!

637
01:06:08,631 --> 01:06:09,966
Amy, don't wander off!

638
01:06:11,092 --> 01:06:14,095
- So do you speak English? 
- Yes.

639
01:06:14,679 --> 01:06:16,889
- What's your name? 
- Claude.

640
01:06:17,056 --> 01:06:23,396
Claude? Heh. That's an unusual name for 
somebody from, um... Where are you from?

641
01:06:23,562 --> 01:06:28,275
- Mombasa. 
- It's an unusual name for Mombasa.

642
01:06:30,403 --> 01:06:33,948
- Have you ever been to Mombasa? 
- Uh, no.

643
01:06:35,783 --> 01:06:38,411
Then what do you know about it?

644
01:06:43,541 --> 01:06:45,292
I want to go home.

645
01:06:50,214 --> 01:06:51,549
Amy?

646
01:06:54,009 --> 01:06:56,095
Amy, come here.

647
01:06:56,262 --> 01:07:00,474
Where are you, girl? 
Come on, I'm not fooling around.

648
01:07:03,561 --> 01:07:04,812
Amy.

649
01:07:05,896 --> 01:07:07,481
Amy?

650
01:07:10,067 --> 01:07:13,529
Come here, girl. Amy.

651
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:27,626
Charles!

652
01:07:29,879 --> 01:07:31,547
Charlie!

653
01:07:33,591 --> 01:07:35,801
- What are those holes? 
- Lava tubes.

654
01:07:35,968 --> 01:07:38,846
Molten rock must be flowing 
through this whole place.

655
01:07:39,013 --> 01:07:41,390
This must lead to the mine.

656
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,520
Please, bring a light.

657
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,066
Here.

658
01:07:52,693 --> 01:07:56,197
Now here. Come on.

659
01:07:56,363 --> 01:07:59,700
Up here. No...!

660
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:03,454
- That's not going anywhere. 
- Where could they be? What happened?

661
01:08:05,748 --> 01:08:08,959
Shit! Let's get out of 
here while we still can.

662
01:08:09,126 --> 01:08:10,127
Help me!

663
01:08:11,045 --> 01:08:13,380
- What's that? 
- Richard!

664
01:08:14,006 --> 01:08:16,967
- Richard? 
- Help me!

665
01:08:19,345 --> 01:08:20,179
- Richard! 
-

666
01:08:20,262 --> 01:08:22,640
No! Richard! Oh, my God! Something...

667
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:57,341
- Richard. 
- Come on.

668
01:08:57,508 --> 01:08:59,593
Let's get out of here.

669
01:09:03,264 --> 01:09:06,016
- It's okay. 
- Peter.

670
01:09:20,865 --> 01:09:23,367
They're gorillas. 
They're some kind of gorillas.

671
01:09:26,036 --> 01:09:30,791
I never saw an animal move like 
that. They just... Look. They just kill.

672
01:09:30,958 --> 01:09:35,796
That's why the diamonds were never 
found. The myth of the killer ape is true.

673
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,631
I can't believe it.

674
01:10:04,158 --> 01:10:06,160
<i>Bad gorillas.</i>

675
01:10:07,411 --> 01:10:10,456
Let me turn your volume down.

676
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,212
Here's your lovey.

677
01:10:19,298 --> 01:10:21,050
Shh.

678
01:10:21,217 --> 01:10:25,512
<i>- It's</i> okay. 
<i>- Mother. Mother.</i>

679
01:10:25,679 --> 01:10:27,139
Yes, you're okay now.

680
01:10:36,148 --> 01:10:40,027
- See anything? 
- No, but I'm the last line of defense.

681
01:10:40,152 --> 01:10:42,821
They have sensor-operated machine pistols 
on tripods.

682
01:10:42,071 --> 01:10:45,741
Anything comes within 40 ft., 
get ready to the 4th of July.

683
01:10:45,908 --> 01:10:48,118
What can I say, you 
really know how to pack.

684
01:10:59,129 --> 01:11:01,215
- I don't see anything. 
- Put that out.

685
01:11:22,152 --> 01:11:24,071
They're testing their perimeter.

686
01:11:32,329 --> 01:11:33,747
How intelligent are they?

687
01:11:33,914 --> 01:11:36,291
Gorillas are very smart, 
but they're not aggressive.

688
01:11:36,458 --> 01:11:40,004
- These things are very aggressive. 
- I'd say they're smart. Too damn smart.

689
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:43,132
They're out there, but what are they doing?

690
01:11:43,799 --> 01:11:45,092
Monroe!

691
01:12:43,776 --> 01:12:44,985
Get down!

692
01:12:55,788 --> 01:12:58,791
- They're gone. 
- Couple of hours until first light.

693
01:12:58,916 --> 01:13:00,959
Then we're out of here.

694
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:08,759
Those hieroglyphics 
we saw inscribed everywhere?

695
01:13:09,259 --> 01:13:11,470
- I have translated them. 
- What do they say?

696
01:13:11,637 --> 01:13:15,682
"We are watching you."

697
01:13:29,279 --> 01:13:32,407
We must have hit some of them. 
Where are the bodies?

698
01:13:32,574 --> 01:13:34,535
- Have you seen Amy? She's gone. 
- No.

699
01:13:34,701 --> 01:13:39,373
She's joined the club, then. We've got two 
porters missing and Homolka's run off, too.

700
01:13:39,540 --> 01:13:43,377
- I'm going to find her. 
- People come first, then gorillas.

701
01:13:43,544 --> 01:13:44,878
- Do you agree? 
- Yes.

702
01:13:45,045 --> 01:13:50,008
Good. We'll retrieve our comrades, 
then we'll retrieve your missing gorilla.

703
01:13:50,175 --> 01:13:53,762
Then we'll get the hell out of here. 
Mount up!

704
01:15:28,607 --> 01:15:31,735
Here's the story. 
They domesticated gorillas.

705
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:34,655
You call that 
domesticated? They're killing a man.

706
01:15:34,821 --> 01:15:39,368
They taught them to be this way. 
They bred them to violence.

707
01:15:39,493 --> 01:15:42,704
They looked for the trait 
and they encouraged it.

708
01:15:43,247 --> 01:15:46,583
Guard dogs, and they 
turned on their masters.

709
01:15:48,460 --> 01:15:50,629
What's that smell?

710
01:15:52,506 --> 01:15:54,299
These are all the bones of gorillas.

711
01:15:54,466 --> 01:15:57,678
- You mean, these are...? 
- No, these are normal gorillas.

712
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,891
- This one's skull was crushed. 
- Feel that?

713
01:16:03,058 --> 01:16:04,226
Feel what?

714
01:16:20,284 --> 01:16:21,743
Hang on!

715
01:16:29,668 --> 01:16:33,046
- Everybody okay? 
- Yeah, let's go.

716
01:16:35,966 --> 01:16:39,845
Don't go this way. It's all caved in. 
God, I'm so glad to see you.

717
01:16:39,970 --> 01:16:44,057
- I was trying to find the mines... 
- Be quiet. Got any flares, Kahega?

718
01:16:44,224 --> 01:16:45,642
Yeah!

719
01:16:48,312 --> 01:16:51,023
- What's making my eyes burn? 
- Sulfur fumes.

720
01:16:51,189 --> 01:16:53,483
Let's hope there's another way out of here.

721
01:17:06,872 --> 01:17:08,290
Careful.

722
01:17:28,518 --> 01:17:33,106
- What the hell...? 
- It's the mines!

723
01:17:33,273 --> 01:17:38,111
"We are watching you." It's the trainers 
talking. The teacher is watching you.

724
01:17:38,612 --> 01:17:40,155
Dead teachers.

725
01:17:45,535 --> 01:17:46,745
Look.

726
01:17:51,875 --> 01:17:56,588
Yes, yes, yes. I knew it was true!

727
01:17:58,006 --> 01:18:01,802
The city of Zinj, the diamonds...

728
01:18:05,430 --> 01:18:10,519
Every word of it was absolutely true.

729
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:14,523
I'd leave those alone.

730
01:18:20,946 --> 01:18:22,864
- Any other way out of here? 
- Not that I've noticed.

731
01:18:25,575 --> 01:18:28,495
Help me. Fill up everything.

732
01:18:39,131 --> 01:18:42,134
- You've got to get me out of here! 
- Take a number.

733
01:18:42,300 --> 01:18:45,429
- But we're going to be rich! 
- ls that a way out?

734
01:18:45,595 --> 01:18:46,638
Maybe.

735
01:19:21,715 --> 01:19:23,258
Look out!

736
01:19:45,071 --> 01:19:47,407
- Let's go. 
- Stay close together.

737
01:19:54,080 --> 01:19:58,168
- What is it? 
- It's a geode. A giant diamond.

738
01:19:59,878 --> 01:20:03,715
- They cut him off. Kahega! 
- Check if there's a way out back there.

739
01:20:13,183 --> 01:20:14,768
Kahega!

740
01:20:39,501 --> 01:20:41,294
Jeffrey...

741
01:20:43,046 --> 01:20:44,756
Charlie!

742
01:20:45,882 --> 01:20:47,342
Charlie!

743
01:20:48,635 --> 01:20:50,554
- It's him? 
- It's him.

744
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,227
Come on.

745
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:13,410
- Is there a way out back there? 
- No, nothing.

746
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:18,915
- We're almost out of rounds. 
- Buy me two minutes.

747
01:21:46,568 --> 01:21:47,819
Let me try.

748
01:21:49,362 --> 01:21:50,864
Aah!

749
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,648
Ugly gorillas. Ugly. Go</i> away.

750
01:22:28,777 --> 01:22:30,779
They don't know what to make of it.

751
01:22:41,539 --> 01:22:45,126
<i>- Amy. 
- Mother. Mother.</i>

752
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:54,052
- Peter hug <i>Amy.</i> 
- Maternal instinct, long may she reign.

753
01:22:54,219 --> 01:22:56,888
- What are you doing? 
- What am I doing? I'll tell you.

754
01:22:57,013 --> 01:22:58,932
- We're getting out. 
- What about them?

755
01:22:59,099 --> 01:23:01,893
Put them on 
the endangered species list.

756
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:13,029
Come on, Monroe. Let's go! Move!

757
01:23:13,196 --> 01:23:16,324
- What the hell is that? 
- The latest thing in communication.

758
01:23:16,449 --> 01:23:18,368
- Climb! 
- Up here.

759
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:22,956
- Go! Go! 
- Come on.

760
01:24:01,161 --> 01:24:02,579
Come on!

761
01:24:09,419 --> 01:24:11,546
Come on, girl. Come on!

762
01:24:22,682 --> 01:24:23,892
GO, Amy!

763
01:24:46,331 --> 01:24:48,208
Keep going!

764
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:53,296
- Unh. 
- Come on, come on.

765
01:24:57,092 --> 01:24:58,343
Wait!

766
01:25:01,137 --> 01:25:02,847
- Where are they? 
- I don't know.

767
01:25:22,158 --> 01:25:23,785
Hang on!

768
01:25:27,455 --> 01:25:29,332
Watch out!

769
01:25:31,084 --> 01:25:33,878
- Go, Amy! 
- Hurry!

770
01:25:34,045 --> 01:25:36,965
Just hurry! Come on!

771
01:25:44,889 --> 01:25:47,809
- Come on! 
- You can do it!

772
01:25:49,561 --> 01:25:50,854
Keep moving.

773
01:25:51,855 --> 01:25:53,606
Head for higher ground.

774
01:25:54,482 --> 01:25:56,234
Keep going, Amy!

775
01:26:26,931 --> 01:26:30,018
Should be a big yellow case 
with a red stripe on that plane.

776
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:33,062
It's a balloon. I'll get the transmitter.

777
01:26:35,064 --> 01:26:36,191
Amy!

778
01:26:40,945 --> 01:26:42,614
Amy!

779
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:45,867
- How close is the border? 
- Not far.

780
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,952
This is Karen Ross, 81452.

781
01:26:48,119 --> 01:26:53,333
That is KR 81452. 
Houston, Travis, do you read?

782
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:56,586
<i>KR 81452.</i>

783
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:59,297
Houston, Travis, do you read?

784
01:26:59,505 --> 01:27:06,429
81452, that is KR 81452. 
Houston, Travis, do you read?

785
01:27:08,640 --> 01:27:12,518
- Karen, is that you? 
<i>- It's</i> me, Travis.

786
01:27:12,685 --> 01:27:15,688
I thought I'd lost you. 
I sent another expedition.

787
01:27:15,813 --> 01:27:21,986
<i>- Did</i> you get <i>it?</i> 
- I have bad news. Charles was killed.

788
01:27:22,362 --> 01:27:26,866
Did you get the diamond? Did you?

789
01:27:30,328 --> 01:27:34,457
<i>- Yes.</i> 
- Good girl.

790
01:27:36,668 --> 01:27:42,340
Do you remember when I told you 
that if I ever knew you sent me here...

791
01:27:42,507 --> 01:27:47,303
for some diamond, 
and not for Charlie, I'd make you sorry?

792
01:27:47,762 --> 01:27:50,682
<i>Karen, of course I'm upset.</i>

793
01:27:50,807 --> 01:27:55,937
<i>- But what's done is done. I could...</i> 
- I <i>know. You need</i> a <i>new</i> cash <i>machine.</i>

794
01:27:56,104 --> 01:27:57,814
<i>What would happen to the satellite...</i>

795
01:27:57,981 --> 01:28:00,984
if I put its phone number in the laser 
and pulled the trigger?

796
01:28:01,150 --> 01:28:04,237
The chip from the transmitter's 
got the satellite's number.

797
01:28:08,366 --> 01:28:14,247
It's a 12,000 channel chip. 
If you put it through the diamond... Karen!

798
01:28:19,335 --> 01:28:21,170
This is for you, Charlie.

799
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,426
No!

800
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,014
Amy!

801
01:28:34,017 --> 01:28:35,476
There you are.

802
01:28:44,527 --> 01:28:46,779
Amy, you saved me.

803
01:28:49,365 --> 01:28:51,034
It's okay.

804
01:29:08,718 --> 01:29:10,261
Thank you.

805
01:29:14,348 --> 01:29:16,392
I love you, too.

806
01:29:18,353 --> 01:29:19,896
Mother?

807
01:29:23,357 --> 01:29:26,027
Oh, I see. It's Africa. It's your mother.

808
01:29:28,029 --> 01:29:31,115
Amy, where did you go?

809
01:29:32,992 --> 01:29:36,496
Good gorillas? What good gorillas?

810
01:29:44,962 --> 01:29:46,214
Handsome fella.

811
01:30:12,073 --> 01:30:13,533
Amy...

812
01:30:20,164 --> 01:30:22,708
Look at that. 
ls that Amy with the...?

813
01:30:22,875 --> 01:30:26,546
The silverback. So she's...

814
01:30:28,548 --> 01:30:31,592
I see. I see.

815
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:37,682
She's home.

816
01:30:54,991 --> 01:30:57,368
- Will she be all right? 
- They know what to do.

817
01:30:57,535 --> 01:30:58,828
It's us I'm worried about.

818
01:30:58,995 --> 01:31:02,582
- We've got to go. Come on. 
- Bye, Amy.

819
01:31:37,700 --> 01:31:40,286
- Peter, would you do me a favor? 
- What?

820
01:31:40,453 --> 01:31:42,371
Would you throw this away for me.

821
01:31:43,164 --> 01:31:44,832
You sure?

822
01:31:48,044 --> 01:31:49,045
Ouch.

823
01:31:55,676 --> 01:31:59,430
- There's a wind. 
- I hope it blows us someplace good.

824
01:31:59,597 --> 01:32:01,224
Me too.
