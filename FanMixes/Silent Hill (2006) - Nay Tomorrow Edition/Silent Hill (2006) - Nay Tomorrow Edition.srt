1
00:00:26,401 --> 00:00:28,278
Sharon!

2
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:30,655
She's not here.

3
00:00:30,864 --> 00:00:34,743
Oh, God. 
Christopher, can you see anything?

4
00:00:35,118 --> 00:00:36,453
Sharon!

5
00:00:36,661 --> 00:00:39,372
- Sharon! 
- She's there.

6
00:00:42,041 --> 00:00:43,752
Sharon!

7
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:47,213
Honey!

8
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:52,093
Sharon!

9
00:00:53,470 --> 00:00:55,513
Wait for Mommy!

10
00:01:15,325 --> 00:01:16,534
Sharon!

11
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:24,334
Wait.

12
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:38,181
Sharon! Honey!

13
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:53,780
Oh, my God. Sharon!

14
00:01:53,988 --> 00:01:55,448
Home.

15
00:01:56,115 --> 00:01:57,325
Home.

16
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,118
No!

17
00:02:06,668 --> 00:02:08,837
- Home! Home! 
- We're going home.

18
00:02:09,045 --> 00:02:10,880
Silent Hill!

19
00:02:11,089 --> 00:02:13,758
- Silent Hill! 
- Rose!

20
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:15,885
- Wake up. 
- Hey.

21
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:18,763
- It's okay, sweetie. We're here now. 
- It's okay. It's okay.

22
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:20,473
It's okay.

23
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:24,394
It's okay, baby. 
We're going right home.

24
00:02:24,602 --> 00:02:27,230
- What are we gonna do? 
- We'll get there.

25
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:30,316
We'll find a way through this. 
We'll find a way.

26
00:02:30,525 --> 00:02:32,110
No.

27
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:35,905
- She said it again. 
- I know.

28
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:41,703
- Come on, baby. It's okay. 
- Calm down, baby. It's okay.

29
00:02:41,911 --> 00:02:43,454
- It's okay, baby. 
- We're right here.

30
00:02:47,625 --> 00:02:49,043
It's okay.

31
00:02:50,420 --> 00:02:52,005
It's okay.

32
00:02:54,382 --> 00:02:56,217
It's okay, baby.

33
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:07,896
SILENT HILL

34
00:03:23,369 --> 00:03:26,372
- Wanna see? 
- Sure.

35
00:03:26,581 --> 00:03:29,000
What are you doing there, pumpkin?

36
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:36,257
This is an amazing lion. 
Did you do that all by yourself?

37
00:03:36,841 --> 00:03:39,177
I'm so impressed with you, honey.

38
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:50,647
Hey, you know we're going 
on a special trip, don't you?

39
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,566
Do you know where we're going?

40
00:03:55,109 --> 00:03:56,569
No?

41
00:03:56,778 --> 00:04:00,323
Honey, sometimes when you go 
to sleep, you go on a little walk.

42
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:03,743
And sometimes 
you talk about a place...

43
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:06,829
...called Silent Hill.

44
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,792
I don't remember.

45
00:04:11,292 --> 00:04:13,127
Oh, that's okay, sweetie.

46
00:04:13,294 --> 00:04:17,131
That's why we're gonna go there, 
so you can remember.

47
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:28,268
Daddy's not coming?

48
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:32,397
No, sweetie. 
It's gonna be just you and me.

49
00:05:17,025 --> 00:05:18,985
Break's over, sweetie.

50
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:21,446
You awake?

51
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,365
You wanna go?

52
00:05:31,372 --> 00:05:36,377
Do you not know that we will judge angels? 
Do you not know that the saints will judge the world?

53
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,379
Corinthians 6:2-3

54
00:05:43,051 --> 00:05:45,595
Damn it, Rose. What's going on?

55
00:05:49,057 --> 00:05:50,933
<i>Hi, this is Rose Da Silva.</i>

56
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,854
<i>Please leave a message, 
and I'll call you back.</i>

57
00:06:05,573 --> 00:06:08,576
GHOST TOWN OF AMERICA

58
00:06:12,497 --> 00:06:13,539
SILENT HILL 
WEST VIRGINIA

59
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,707
Oh, no, Rose.

60
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,634
Silent Hill: The Tainted Town

61
00:07:36,581 --> 00:07:38,624
Honey, you're awake?

62
00:07:38,833 --> 00:07:40,042
Long drive.

63
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:42,587
Can I ask you something, sweetie?

64
00:07:45,006 --> 00:07:47,425
Why did you change your pictures?

65
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,637
I didn't.

66
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:53,848
- Mommy? 
- You can't remember?

67
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:57,268
No. I don't like that, Mommy.

68
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:01,022
- Baby, you can't remember doing this? 
- Who did that?

69
00:08:01,230 --> 00:08:04,275
- Hey, hey, baby, it's okay. 
- Mommy, who did that?

70
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:06,652
It's okay, honey. Mommy's here.

71
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,281
Can you wait in the car for me?

72
00:08:10,489 --> 00:08:12,909
Can I sit in front?

73
00:08:13,534 --> 00:08:16,871
- Of course you can sit in the front. 
- Okay.

74
00:08:29,383 --> 00:08:31,719
Jimmy, we need 
a ham and cheese on white.

75
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,346
Hi.

76
00:08:34,388 --> 00:08:37,058
I just wanna pay for the gas.

77
00:08:37,266 --> 00:08:40,353
And can you tell me the best way 
to get to Silent Hill?

78
00:08:40,561 --> 00:08:43,522
I can't seem to find it on the map.

79
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:47,193
- Why do you wanna go there? 
- I...I read about it.

80
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:50,154
Road don't go through no more.

81
00:08:50,863 --> 00:08:53,032
Your card was declined.

82
00:08:56,410 --> 00:08:57,995
Hey there.

83
00:08:58,246 --> 00:09:02,750
- Is everything all right? 
- Don't talk to strangers.

84
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,836
Good girl.

85
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:09,048
All right. Well, thanks for your help.

86
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:15,429
Why did you cut off the cards?

87
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:17,682
<i>That's not gonna stop me 
from taking her there.</i>

88
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,810
Listen, honey, 
we gotta put Sharon in a hospital.

89
00:09:21,143 --> 00:09:23,312
<i>She needs constant care, 
and she needs medication.</i>

90
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,232
The medication doesn't work.

91
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:29,026
She's getting worse every day.

92
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:32,905
Honey, the adoption people said 
Sharon came from West Virginia...

93
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,616
<i>...and Silent Hill is in West Virginia.</i>

94
00:09:35,825 --> 00:09:37,660
<i>I'm not giving up on her, Chris. 
I'm not.</i>

95
00:09:37,868 --> 00:09:39,787
Have you actually read 
the websites, Rose?

96
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,748
<i>Yes, Chris, I read them.</i>

97
00:09:42,957 --> 00:09:46,502
Just trust me on this, please? 
Just trust me on this.

98
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,296
<i>Listen, honey...</i>

99
00:09:48,504 --> 00:09:52,008
<i>- I love Sharon every bit as much as I... 
- Chris, I gotta go.</i>

100
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:55,886
...I love you.

101
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:59,724
- Need any help, ma'am? 
- No, we're...We're fine, thanks.

102
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:04,061
We're fine.

103
00:11:19,887 --> 00:11:21,889
Are we there?

104
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:24,475
Not yet, honey.

105
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,780
Keep your seatbelt fastened.

106
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,325
Hey!

107
00:12:01,345 --> 00:12:03,055
Mommy!

108
00:12:34,462 --> 00:12:36,964
It's okay. It's just the radio.

109
00:12:37,173 --> 00:12:39,383
- I'm turning it off. 
- Mommy!

110
00:13:30,893 --> 00:13:32,102
Sharon?

111
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:40,444
Sharon!

112
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:44,156
Somebody! Help!

113
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:46,325
Please!

114
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:51,330
We've had an accident!

115
00:13:56,126 --> 00:13:58,045
Anybody!

116
00:14:06,303 --> 00:14:09,014
Sharon. Honey.

117
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,279
Ashes.

118
00:14:35,708 --> 00:14:37,710
WELCOME TO SILENT HILL

119
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:38,979
Sharon!

120
00:15:44,193 --> 00:15:45,194
Sharon!

121
00:15:45,986 --> 00:15:47,613
Wait!

122
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:49,531
Sharon!

123
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:51,241
Wait!

124
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:16,058
Sharon!

125
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:21,980
Sharon?

126
00:16:29,071 --> 00:16:30,656
Honey?

127
00:17:18,412 --> 00:17:19,580
What's happening?

128
00:17:26,670 --> 00:17:28,380
<i>Mommy.</i>

129
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:31,550
Sharon.

130
00:18:06,502 --> 00:18:08,295
Sharon?

131
00:18:21,225 --> 00:18:23,018
Sharon?

132
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:51,839
Hello?

133
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,987
Wait!

134
00:19:17,990 --> 00:19:19,324
Sharon.

135
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,159
Sharon.

136
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:24,538
Sharon.

137
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:47,811
Help me!

138
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,900
Help.

139
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:55,777
Help me. Help.

140
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:58,655
Someone! Shit!

141
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:02,576
Get off me! Get off!

142
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,361
Get off! Get off!

143
00:20:37,569 --> 00:20:38,862
Get off me!

144
00:20:39,071 --> 00:20:41,740
No! Get off me!

145
00:20:43,533 --> 00:20:45,744
No! Get off me! Get off me!

146
00:20:59,508 --> 00:21:00,842
Get off...!

147
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:55,874
Only the dark one opens 
and closes the door to Silent Hill.

148
00:22:56,083 --> 00:22:57,667
Please.

149
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:02,464
I don't know what's happening. 
Do you know what's going on here?

150
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,176
My daughter.

151
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,388
I'm looking for my daughter. 
I'm afraid that she's been hurt.

152
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:11,973
We've all lost our children.

153
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:14,059
Our light.

154
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,020
They deceived me.

155
00:23:17,229 --> 00:23:18,605
Their evil.

156
00:23:19,147 --> 00:23:21,358
Their hate.

157
00:23:23,735 --> 00:23:25,862
They hurt my child.

158
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:28,031
They did terrible things to her.

159
00:23:29,366 --> 00:23:31,034
Alessa.

160
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:35,247
This is my daughter, Sharon.

161
00:23:35,455 --> 00:23:37,374
She sleepwalks, 
so you have to be careful...

162
00:23:37,582 --> 00:23:42,712
...but if you see her, 
please, tell her to wait for me.

163
00:23:43,130 --> 00:23:45,841
Yes, she's mine.

164
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,217
- It was mine. 
- It's mine.

165
00:23:47,426 --> 00:23:49,261
- It's mine. 
- It's mine!

166
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,263
- It's mine! 
- Get off me!

167
00:23:58,979 --> 00:24:02,566
lnto the fire 
she swallowed their hate.

168
00:24:30,802 --> 00:24:33,305
- Hi there. 
- Yeah.

169
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:38,727
Listen, my wife, 
she came through here last night.

170
00:24:38,935 --> 00:24:41,605
- Maybe you saw her? 
- Daughter worked night shift.

171
00:24:43,815 --> 00:24:48,904
Actually, she was heading 
for this place, Silent Hill.

172
00:24:49,112 --> 00:24:51,281
- How do I get there? 
- You don't.

173
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:53,450
Town's closed down 
because of the coal fire...

174
00:24:53,658 --> 00:24:56,119
...still burning underground, 
you know?

175
00:24:56,328 --> 00:24:58,872
Breathe enough of them fumes, 
oh, bound to kill you.

176
00:25:01,917 --> 00:25:03,418
Okay...

177
00:25:04,961 --> 00:25:06,963
...where's the turnoff?

178
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:21,728
Sharon?

179
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:55,220
Come on.

180
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,981
<i>Hi, this is Chris. 
Please leave a message.</i>

181
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:08,149
Christopher, it's me.

182
00:26:08,817 --> 00:26:12,320
I'm in Silent Hill. 
I'm sorry, I made a mistake.

183
00:26:12,529 --> 00:26:14,781
Sharon's lost, 
but I think I know where she is...

184
00:26:14,990 --> 00:26:18,243
...so I'm going to the school 
to look for her.

185
00:26:19,286 --> 00:26:21,955
I'm not okay, all right? 
I need your help.

186
00:26:22,163 --> 00:26:25,834
Please, please, hurry.

187
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:29,713
Fuck. Come on!

188
00:26:29,921 --> 00:26:32,340
Ma'am, I want you to put 
both hands on the wheel.

189
00:26:35,093 --> 00:26:37,512
Put both hands on the wheel.

190
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:41,516
Where's the little girl, ma'am?

191
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:45,312
Please, my daughter, she's gone. 
I need your help.

192
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:47,480
- Get out of the car. 
- What?

193
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:49,232
Move it.

194
00:26:50,442 --> 00:26:52,068
Jesus, what are you doing?

195
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,404
- You're under arrest. 
- What?

196
00:26:54,612 --> 00:26:57,574
Anything you say can and will be 
used against you in a court of law.

197
00:26:57,782 --> 00:27:00,577
I don't think you understand. 
There's something weird going on.

198
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,287
My daughter, she's in danger.

199
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:04,581
If you really cared, 
you wouldn't have sped off.

200
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:07,042
Listen to me, she 's ill. 
She sleepwalks.

201
00:27:07,250 --> 00:27:09,628
Just calm right down. 
I'm gonna find the little girl.

202
00:27:11,963 --> 00:27:14,299
Officer Bennett to base, over.

203
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:18,511
Base, do you copy, over?

204
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,598
- Shit. 
- You're bleeding.

205
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,104
Cracked my head on the road 
pretty good...

206
00:27:28,313 --> 00:27:31,775
...when my bike went down. 
I must have been out for a while.

207
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,487
- You all right to walk? 
- Sure.

208
00:27:35,695 --> 00:27:38,281
Then it looks like we'll be 
hiking back to Brahams.

209
00:27:38,490 --> 00:27:39,824
What?

210
00:27:41,076 --> 00:27:42,786
You're going back to the station.

211
00:27:42,994 --> 00:27:45,121
- Are you kidding? 
- Nope.

212
00:27:45,080 --> 00:27:47,666
Have you heard 
a single word I've said?

213
00:27:47,874 --> 00:27:49,459
- Yeah, I hear you. 
- Have you heard...

214
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,127
...a single word I've said?

215
00:27:52,087 --> 00:27:54,756
I'm sure she's at the school, 
we just need to turn around...

216
00:27:54,964 --> 00:27:57,759
<i>...Silent Hill... 
...sorry...</i>

217
00:27:57,967 --> 00:27:59,511
<i>...Sharon... 
...lost...</i>

218
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:05,308
<i>...think I know where... 
...going to the school to look for her...</i>

219
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:07,018
<i>I'm not okay...</i>

220
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:11,398
<i>I need your...Your help. 
Please, hurry!</i>

221
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,918
Sorry, sir, this road is closed. 
You'll have to turn around.

222
00:28:32,127 --> 00:28:34,963
I'm looking for my wife. 
She may have come through here.

223
00:28:35,839 --> 00:28:40,218
She drives a Jeep Liberty. 
Silver, Ohio plates.

224
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:44,764
Sir, this man's wife 
was driving the Jeep.

225
00:28:45,724 --> 00:28:46,725
<i>Bring him down.</i>

226
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,518
- Come on. 
- You've seen her?

227
00:28:55,066 --> 00:28:56,151
Where is she?

228
00:28:56,818 --> 00:28:59,237
lnspector Thomas Gucci. 
Enjoying the weather, are you?

229
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,656
For God's sake, 
I'm trying to find my wife.

230
00:29:01,865 --> 00:29:03,074
I know. Hang on a second.

231
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,660
Now, that vehicle you were 
talking about, we found it.

232
00:29:05,869 --> 00:29:08,079
It's at the end of the bridge here, 
but it's empty.

233
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:10,790
We've got no indication 
anyone's come under any harm.

234
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,792
- Good Christ. 
- Now, you mind telling me...

235
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,961
...what your wife's doing 
up here, Mr...?

236
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,255
- Da Silva, Chris Da Silva. 
- My pleasure, Chris...

237
00:29:17,464 --> 00:29:20,133
The faster we start looking, 
the faster we're gonna find her.

238
00:29:20,341 --> 00:29:22,802
All right, hold your horses, 
hold your horses, Chris.

239
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,054
I've also got a missing deputy.

240
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:27,390
And knowing Officer Cybil Bennett 
the way I do...

241
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,351
...she's probably out there looking 
for your wife and daughter.

242
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:32,854
Bobby, make sure no one 
comes through that barricade.

243
00:29:33,062 --> 00:29:34,939
We're gonna get our asses up 
to Silent Hill.

244
00:29:35,148 --> 00:29:36,733
- Let's take a look around. 
- Yes, sir.

245
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,776
While Chris here tells me 
what's going on.

246
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:43,490
She disappeared yesterday. 
I spoke to her...

247
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:45,366
...when she stopped for gas 
in Brahams.

248
00:29:46,075 --> 00:29:48,453
Why were you coming up here 
in the middle of the night?

249
00:29:48,661 --> 00:29:52,123
- I thought it would help her. 
- You people. You get off the highway...

250
00:29:52,290 --> 00:29:55,919
...from whatever big city, bringing 
all your sick problems with you.

251
00:29:57,795 --> 00:30:00,048
Why aren't you listening to me?

252
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:02,634
We had a guy come up here 
two years ago...

253
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:06,095
...snatched a little boy from a rest stop, 
dropped him into a mine vent.

254
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:08,139
I never wanna see 
anything like that again.

255
00:30:08,348 --> 00:30:11,142
Look, I don't know what 
you're thinking, but you're not helping.

256
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,520
There is no way I would ever 
harm my own daughter.

257
00:30:13,728 --> 00:30:16,064
How do I even know 
she is your daughter?

258
00:30:16,272 --> 00:30:17,649
Come on.

259
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:24,364
What the hell?

260
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:02,151
Okay.

261
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,571
Now do you see 
what I'm talking about?

262
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,364
Will you take these handcuffs 
off me?

263
00:31:06,573 --> 00:31:08,992
No. Get walking.

264
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,828
There's a fire-Iookout tower 
on the far side of Toluca Lake.

265
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:14,747
- It should have a radio. 
- Fuck you, you stupid cop.

266
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:18,251
This place is completely cut off.

267
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,546
- You have no idea what's going on. 
- Hey!

268
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,841
Hey, you up there!

269
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,136
I'm a police officer!

270
00:31:32,223 --> 00:31:33,891
What's going on?

271
00:31:41,566 --> 00:31:43,401
What is that?

272
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:49,240
Stand back.

273
00:31:52,744 --> 00:31:55,204
Jesus Christ, shoot it.

274
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:09,719
Stay where you are!

275
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:12,889
Stop!

276
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:54,073
MIDWICH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL

...when a wife takes a run...

291
00:36:11,878 --> 00:36:14,172
...she takes the daughter 
to a place like this...

292
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:16,382
...I'd say she's damn mad 
at her husband.

293
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,344
You like hauling skeletons 
out of your family closet?

294
00:36:20,511 --> 00:36:23,973
No, not all the time, but we're 
driving on top of them right now.

295
00:36:24,182 --> 00:36:26,601
Coal fire's still burning 
underneath.

296
00:36:26,809 --> 00:36:28,686
You see the barbershop over there?

297
00:36:29,187 --> 00:36:31,731
- Used to be my father's. 
- Your father?

298
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:34,984
He's dead.

299
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:37,737
November '74, 
when the fire caught.

300
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:41,282
They tried to evacuate this place 
as quick as they could...

301
00:36:41,490 --> 00:36:44,535
...but it was hellish, people were 
dying and disappearing.

302
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:47,330
Hell, they couldn't even find 
half the bodies.

303
00:36:47,538 --> 00:36:49,123
That was the end of Silent Hill.

304
00:36:49,332 --> 00:36:52,501
These were good people, 
most of them.

305
00:36:52,793 --> 00:36:55,087
Some, you might say deserved it.

306
00:36:55,296 --> 00:36:56,839
A little bit.

00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:14,649

Help me. Oh, God. 
Please, please, help me. Help...

Rose, where are you?

326
00:44:19,948 --> 00:44:22,493
- I felt her. 
- You what?

327
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,036
Her perfume.

328
00:44:25,412 --> 00:44:26,789
- She was here. 
- Who was?

329
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,041
- My wife. 
- She wasn't here. Put this mask on.

330
00:44:29,249 --> 00:44:32,002
- Perfume. 
- Breathe. Through that mask.

331
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:36,090
Come on, let's go. 
We're gonna go this way.

332
00:44:36,298 --> 00:44:38,092
Chris, come on.

333
00:44:40,094 --> 00:44:41,970
- She was here. 
- No, no, she wasn't here.

334
00:44:42,179 --> 00:44:43,138
I know it.

335
00:44:58,946 --> 00:44:59,279
Come on.

336
00:45:00,406 --> 00:45:02,157
Come on. Let's keep looking.

00:45:28,684 --> 00:45:30,853
Get off! Get off! Get off!

338
00:45:34,690 --> 00:45:36,567
Get me that pipe.

339
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,695

340
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,865
Okay. Okay.

341
00:45:44,491 --> 00:45:47,202
- I got it. I got it. 
- Quick, come on!

342
00:46:02,634 --> 00:46:04,386
Can we get out of here?

343
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:06,555
We're trapped.

00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,046
That's him.

349
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,386
Stay down! Stay down!

350
00:46:46,595 --> 00:46:48,680
Jesus Christ.

351
00:46:50,307 --> 00:46:52,184
Get down!

352
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:00,859
Shit!

353
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:54,454
What?

354
00:48:34,161 --> 00:48:35,495
What the fuck?

355
00:48:37,247 --> 00:48:38,206
What the fuck?

356
00:48:40,542 --> 00:48:43,211
You saw that, right? 
That was real?

357
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,132
What the fuck is going on?

358
00:48:47,341 --> 00:48:50,052
All right, I know this is crazy. I know.

359
00:48:50,260 --> 00:48:52,638
We gotta calm right down, 
because my kid is not here...

360
00:48:52,846 --> 00:48:55,766
...and I've gotta find her 
before this happens again.

361
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:58,644
I don't even know where to start.

362
00:48:59,061 --> 00:49:00,729
I found this.

363
00:49:00,937 --> 00:49:02,898
It's from a hotel.

364
00:49:03,106 --> 00:49:06,026
I don't know where it is, 
but she is in this hotel.

365
00:49:06,777 --> 00:49:08,445
Hotel?

366
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:17,287
It's gonna be okay.

367
00:49:19,039 --> 00:49:21,041
We're gonna be okay.

368
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,889
Now, don't be trying 
anything, all right?

369
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:38,100
We got men up here 
all night long.

370
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:41,019
We're gonna find your wife, 
we're gonna find your daughter.

371
00:49:41,228 --> 00:49:44,147
Can't have civilians 
wandering around on their own.

372
00:49:44,815 --> 00:49:46,942
You're not telling me everything.

373
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,528
What really happened up here?

374
00:49:49,736 --> 00:49:52,030
Just let it rest in peace.

375
00:49:55,283 --> 00:49:57,661
<i>- Directory assistance.

<i>One moment.</i>

377
00:49:59,705 --> 00:50:02,040
<i>- Archives? 
- Yeah, listen.</i>

378
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:04,835
Do you have the records there 
from Silent Hill?

379
00:50:05,043 --> 00:50:08,171
<i>- Which records, sir? 
- The police records.</i>

380
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:10,841
<i>Sorry, sir, 
those records are confidential.</i>

381
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,176
No, no, I can't... 
No, listen, I...

382
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:15,595
<i>Sorry, sir, 
I can't access that information.</i>

383
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:17,264
<i>- Listen, goddamn it. 
- Sir.</i>

384
00:50:17,472 --> 00:50:18,849
<i>- This is an emergency. 
- I can't...</i>

385
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,059
<i>I can't help you.</i>

386
00:50:37,325 --> 00:50:39,995
They used to say 
this place was haunted.

387
00:50:40,662 --> 00:50:42,748
I think they were right.

388
00:50:43,290 --> 00:50:44,583
GRAND HOTEL

389
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,801
<i>Help! No!</i>

390
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,845
<i>- Stay away. 
- Come on.</i>

391
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:59,931
Stay away, sinner.

392
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:01,475
Get back!

393
00:51:03,685 --> 00:51:05,353
It's here.

394
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:10,275
Faith is our destroyer. 
Faith has brought us doom.

395
00:51:10,275 --> 00:51:11,485
- Get back! 
- Hey, hey!

396
00:51:11,693 --> 00:51:14,613
- Get back! 
- Hey, stop.

397
00:51:14,821 --> 00:51:17,199
Think you of thee 
who cast the first stone.

398
00:51:17,407 --> 00:51:19,743
Lambs without a shepherd, 
shepherd without a flock.

399
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,496
It's your sins which hold you here.

400
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,247
- Stop your lies! 
- Calm down.

401
00:51:24,456 --> 00:51:25,415
Calm down, it's okay.

402
00:51:25,624 --> 00:51:27,709
- We're not gonna hurt you. 
- She's gone.

403
00:51:28,752 --> 00:51:30,295
What's your name?

404
00:51:30,670 --> 00:51:34,216
Anna. My name is Anna.

405
00:51:34,424 --> 00:51:36,468
What's going on here, Anna? 
Who was that?

406
00:51:36,676 --> 00:51:39,721
- I've seen her before. 
- Dahlia was cast out.

407
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:42,015
Not even the darkness wants her.

408
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:44,810
- She's lost her daughter too. 
- What?

409
00:51:45,018 --> 00:51:50,357
- Sinners deserve to lose their spawn. 
- What are you doing here, Anna?

410
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,694
Mother needs more food.

411
00:51:55,320 --> 00:51:56,905
You mean there are 
other people here?

412
00:52:00,033 --> 00:52:01,993
Christabella keeps us safe.

413
00:52:02,202 --> 00:52:04,621
- Anna. 
- We take refuge in the church.

414
00:52:05,163 --> 00:52:08,041
Anna, listen to me.

415
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:11,002
I've lost my daughter. 
She's all alone.

416
00:52:11,336 --> 00:52:14,005
Can you imagine how frightened 
she must feel?

417
00:52:14,214 --> 00:52:16,174
Tell me, have you seen her?

418
00:52:16,383 --> 00:52:17,759
Do you know where she is?

419
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:24,474
If she has faith, she might survive.

420
00:52:24,683 --> 00:52:25,642
If not...

421
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:29,729
I'm taking this.

422
00:52:32,065 --> 00:52:33,775
Have you seen this?

423
00:52:34,359 --> 00:52:36,611
I've seen it at the school.

424
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:40,991
It's on all the buildings 
the elders of my elders built.

425
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:45,620
It's a symbol of our unity, 
a symbol of our faith.

426
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,758
Rose, look at this.

427
00:53:00,844 --> 00:53:03,972
- What is it? 
- Just like yours.

428
00:53:05,432 --> 00:53:08,852
- Where did you find it? 
- They're all over the floor.

429
00:53:23,158 --> 00:53:24,326
Rose.

430
00:53:25,118 --> 00:53:26,661
Check this out.

431
00:53:28,538 --> 00:53:32,667
- What number did you take this from? 
- 111.

432
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:36,963
We gotta go to room 111.

433
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:44,572
SILENT HILL POLICE RECORDS

434
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:12,100

00:55:42,672 --> 00:55:44,674
<i>- Directory assistance. 
- Yeah.</i>

436
00:55:45,341 --> 00:55:47,886
Toluca County Orphanage, please.

437
00:55:48,094 --> 00:55:50,096
<i>One moment, please.</i>

438
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,309
<i>- Yes, I have that information for you. 
- Yeah.</i>

439
00:55:55,310 --> 00:55:57,479
Can you give me that address?

440
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:09,866
We are wandering far 
from refuge here.

441
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:14,120
Let's keep her with us. 
She's all we got.

442
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,858
There's no room 111.

443
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:46,486
The first burning.

444
00:56:47,362 --> 00:56:50,865
- What is it, Anna? 
- The first burning.

445
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,992
Before the town had a name.

446
00:56:53,201 --> 00:56:56,663
The elders of my elders 
kept us pure.

447
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,582
The founders of this town 
were witch- hunters.

448
00:57:00,083 --> 00:57:02,544
Burning the witch 
held back the darkness.

449
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,379
It stopped the apocalypse.

450
00:57:10,301 --> 00:57:11,886
It's here.

451
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:30,488
There's a room in here.

452
00:57:41,916 --> 00:57:43,543
Look at this.

453
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:53,052
Here.

454
00:57:53,761 --> 00:57:55,430
Damn.

455
00:58:10,570 --> 00:58:12,780
What is this place?

456
00:58:12,989 --> 00:58:15,158
I don't know. 
We're in the next building.

457
00:58:15,366 --> 00:58:17,452
Some factory, maybe?

458
00:58:19,162 --> 00:58:21,289
Looks like there was a fire.

459
00:58:50,401 --> 00:58:52,070
Rose!

460
00:59:22,892 --> 00:59:24,727
Who are you?

461
00:59:37,156 --> 00:59:38,908
It's okay.

462
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:43,454
Don't be scared. 
I promise I'm not gonna hurt you.

463
01:00:01,764 --> 01:00:03,433
Rose?

464
01:00:25,288 --> 01:00:27,624
Okay. Come on.

465
01:00:27,790 --> 01:00:29,500
Come on.

466
01:00:33,796 --> 01:00:36,883
It's okay. Hey.

467
01:00:41,596 --> 01:00:43,264
It's okay.

468
01:00:50,396 --> 01:00:51,689
It's okay.

469
01:00:51,898 --> 01:00:54,067
I'm not gonna hurt you.

470
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:05,578
Oh, my God.

471
01:01:06,245 --> 01:01:08,289
You could be her twin.

472
01:01:12,502 --> 01:01:13,586
Are you Alessa?

473
01:01:16,255 --> 01:01:18,341
Where's my Sharon?

474
01:01:19,050 --> 01:01:20,843
Look at me.

475
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,305
I'm burning.

476
01:01:27,141 --> 01:01:28,643
Rose?

477
01:01:31,521 --> 01:01:32,605
Rose? My God.

478
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:36,067
- How did you get over there? 
- Where is she?

479
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,823
Grab onto it.

480
01:01:43,241 --> 01:01:46,828
- Now swing back around. 
- Okay.

481
01:01:51,624 --> 01:01:53,000
- Are you all right? 
- Yeah.

482
01:01:53,376 --> 01:01:55,086
What the hell 
were you doing over there?

483
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,796
You're gonna get yourself killed.

484
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,674
I think I just saw Dahlia's daughter.

485
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:03,052
She was the one 
that brought us here.

486
01:02:03,261 --> 01:02:04,512
What are you talking about?

487
01:02:04,720 --> 01:02:07,140
She was the one 
that made me crash my car.

488
01:02:07,849 --> 01:02:09,016
Alessa.

489
01:02:09,225 --> 01:02:11,436
We don't say her name.

490
01:02:15,231 --> 01:02:17,734
That's the seal, isn't it, Anna?

491
01:02:18,734 --> 01:02:21,112
The symbol of your faith?

492
01:02:23,865 --> 01:02:26,033
Something terrible happened here.

493
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:33,458
We have to leave. 
We have to leave!

494
01:02:34,750 --> 01:02:36,961
- The darkness is coming! 
- Let's go.

495
01:02:37,420 --> 01:02:39,005
Let's go!

496
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:53,060
The church isn't far.

497
01:02:53,269 --> 01:02:55,146
- Run. Run! 
- Rose, come on!

498
01:02:55,354 --> 01:02:57,064
Rose!

499
01:03:06,949 --> 01:03:08,576
Hurry!

500
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:16,959
Rose.

501
01:03:17,168 --> 01:03:19,670
- Come! 
- We gotta go.

502
01:03:37,313 --> 01:03:39,273
- Rose, come on. 
- I've seen this.

503
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:52,620
Rose, let's go!

504
01:03:54,705 --> 01:03:57,291
- Cybil! 
- Rose, come on.

505
01:04:05,299 --> 01:04:06,259
Cybil!

506
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:09,345
You run not towards sanctuary 
but from your fears.

507
01:04:09,512 --> 01:04:12,265
Do not join the others. 
They are deceivers. They are damned.

508
01:04:12,473 --> 01:04:14,016
- We gotta get inside. 
- No!

509
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:15,810
They are wolves 
in the skin of sheep.

510
01:04:16,018 --> 01:04:18,854
They brought about their own hell. 
They'll take you with them.

511
01:04:19,021 --> 01:04:21,274
- Filth and lies! 
- Hey!

512
01:04:21,482 --> 01:04:22,859
Stop it!

513
01:04:24,193 --> 01:04:27,321
Please. I've seen your daughter. 
I've seen Alessa.

514
01:04:30,366 --> 01:04:32,952
- It's coming! 
- She's dead, isn't she?

515
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,829
Fire doesn't cleanse, it blackens.

516
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,331
- Listen to me. 
- Rose, hurry!

517
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:39,750
She looks exactly like Sharon.

518
01:04:39,959 --> 01:04:42,378
She brought us here, didn't she?

519
01:04:46,132 --> 01:04:48,342
Why? What does she want?

520
01:04:48,551 --> 01:04:50,177
Evil wakes in vengeance.

521
01:04:50,386 --> 01:04:53,014
Be careful what you choose.

522
01:05:12,992 --> 01:05:14,493
Rose!

523
01:06:03,751 --> 01:06:05,711
- No. 
- Send them back!

524
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:07,713
No.

525
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,757
We're lost.

526
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,519
This is a sanctuary.

527
01:06:31,570 --> 01:06:35,032
Please, Christabella, 
they lured my Anna.

528
01:06:35,241 --> 01:06:37,702
They gave her to the fiend.

529
01:06:38,035 --> 01:06:41,622
Eleanor, you must remember 
that Anna went against our laws.

530
01:06:41,831 --> 01:06:44,542
She went alone outside 
into the devil's playground.

531
01:06:46,752 --> 01:06:50,047
She was not the responsibility 
of these two strangers.

532
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:54,135
We'll deal with them later.

533
01:07:00,099 --> 01:07:02,059
Now we must pray.

534
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:22,037
REVELATION 20:11-15

535
01:07:23,038 --> 01:07:24,457
And then I saw them...

536
01:07:24,457 --> 01:07:27,835
...from whose presence 
earth and heaven fled away.

537
01:07:28,294 --> 01:07:30,880
And no home was left to them.

538
01:07:31,088 --> 01:07:33,174
And then I saw them...

539
01:07:33,382 --> 01:07:36,635
...from whose presence 
earth and heaven fled away.

540
01:07:36,844 --> 01:07:39,555
And no home was left to them.

541
01:07:40,014 --> 01:07:42,767
And I saw the dead, 
the great and the small...

542
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:46,103
...and they were judged 
according to their deeds.

543
01:07:46,312 --> 01:07:51,358
And I saw the dead, 
the great and the small...

544
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,779
...and they were judged 
according to their deeds.

545
01:07:57,323 --> 01:08:01,660
And anyone's name not found 
written in the book of life...

546
01:08:01,869 --> 01:08:05,039
...they will be thrown 
into the lake of fire.

547
01:08:13,881 --> 01:08:15,466
Toluca County Orphanage

548
01:08:15,508 --> 01:08:18,385
And now I lay me down to sleep...

549
01:08:18,594 --> 01:08:21,514
...I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

550
01:08:21,680 --> 01:08:24,183
If I should die before I wake...

551
01:08:24,683 --> 01:08:27,937
...I pray the Lord my soul to take.

552
01:08:28,145 --> 01:08:29,980
Amen.

553
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,108
All right, girls, into bed. 
Quickly, now.

554
01:08:33,317 --> 01:08:35,903
No better place to be 
on a rainy night.

555
01:08:36,112 --> 01:08:39,490
In you go, Lindsey, thattagirl. 
You've got your bear, that's a girl.

556
01:08:39,698 --> 01:08:42,076
No. No talking 
after lights are out.

557
01:08:45,871 --> 01:08:47,790
Good night, children.

558
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:50,000
And God bless.

559
01:08:54,004 --> 01:08:56,507
I'm sorry, Sister Margaret, 
this really can't wait.

560
01:08:57,383 --> 01:08:59,218
I can't imagine why.

561
01:09:01,136 --> 01:09:02,930
Nine years ago...

562
01:09:03,139 --> 01:09:05,140
...a baby was left 
outside this orphanage.

563
01:09:05,349 --> 01:09:07,434
My wife and I were the ones 
who adopted her.

564
01:09:07,643 --> 01:09:10,437
I'm very happy for you, 
Mr. Da Silva...

565
01:09:10,646 --> 01:09:14,441
...but I can't give out 
information on our children.

566
01:09:16,068 --> 01:09:17,361
Look.

567
01:09:18,737 --> 01:09:21,699
That girl, she looks 
exactly like my daughter.

568
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:23,909
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

569
01:09:24,118 --> 01:09:26,745
- It's late. 
- She must be 40 now.

570
01:09:26,954 --> 01:09:28,163
Where can I find her?

571
01:09:29,039 --> 01:09:30,916
This story isn't hers alone...

572
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:32,835
- ...but all of ours! 
- You people.

573
01:09:33,043 --> 01:09:34,211
You got yourself something.

574
01:09:34,420 --> 01:09:37,381
You know what you got now, Chris? 
How about breaking and entering?

575
01:09:37,590 --> 01:09:39,675
By the looks of this, 
a little assault as well.

576
01:09:40,384 --> 01:09:42,052
Thank you, Thomas.

577
01:09:42,261 --> 01:09:44,889
- This can't go any farther. 
- It won't, Sister.

578
01:09:46,432 --> 01:09:48,559
You know, 
I have some 12-year-olds...

579
01:09:48,767 --> 01:09:51,145
...who cover their tracks 
better than you do.

580
01:09:51,562 --> 01:09:52,855
What's this?

581
01:09:53,063 --> 01:09:54,607
Look, Gucci, do you know her?

582
01:09:54,815 --> 01:09:57,276
Is that my daughter's birth mother?

583
01:10:02,489 --> 01:10:05,951
- Look, turn around. 
- What are you doing?

584
01:10:08,037 --> 01:10:11,081
I knew that girl. I did.

585
01:10:12,249 --> 01:10:14,752
I was told she didn't make it 
through the night.

586
01:10:15,252 --> 01:10:17,171
The night of the fire.

587
01:10:17,463 --> 01:10:19,423
The night of the big fire 
in Silent Hill.

588
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:24,178
There were these people...

589
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:27,348
...these fanatics.

590
01:10:27,556 --> 01:10:30,768
What they did 
to that child was terrible.

591
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,729
That was 30 years ago, 
and it's over now.

592
01:10:34,188 --> 01:10:35,773
Not as far as I'm concerned.

593
01:10:36,482 --> 01:10:38,484
What's it gonna be, city boy?

594
01:10:38,692 --> 01:10:41,195
I can put you in jail...

595
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:43,072
...or you can go home.

596
01:10:43,697 --> 01:10:46,408
And that's your definition of justice?

597
01:10:47,576 --> 01:10:51,288
Many different forms 
of justice, Chris.

598
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:55,084
See, you've got man's, God's...

599
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,003
...and even the devil's.

600
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:02,132
Certain forms you just can't control.

601
01:11:03,133 --> 01:11:05,302
So I want you to go home now...

602
01:11:05,719 --> 01:11:07,972
...to your nice warm bed...

603
01:11:08,180 --> 01:11:10,599
...and let me deal with this town...

604
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:13,519
...and what has happened 
over the last 30 years.

605
01:11:13,727 --> 01:11:16,480
Okay? End of story.

606
01:11:23,779 --> 01:11:27,700
DOMINE DEUS OMNIPOTENS IN CUIUS MANU

607
01:11:28,909 --> 01:11:31,328
Tell me first how you got here.

608
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,916
Honestly, I don't know 
how I got here.

609
01:11:36,125 --> 01:11:39,003
Right now, I've lost my little girl...

610
01:11:39,211 --> 01:11:41,839
...and all I know is that 
I'm supposed to be in this church.

611
01:11:42,047 --> 01:11:44,049
Are you a person of faith?

612
01:11:44,258 --> 01:11:46,510
- I love my daughter. 
- That's not what I asked.

613
01:11:46,927 --> 01:11:48,053
Who are you to judge?

614
01:11:48,262 --> 01:11:51,473
We judge because the souls of history 
hang in the balance.

615
01:11:51,682 --> 01:11:53,308
Because our faith 
has never failed us.

616
01:11:53,517 --> 01:11:55,936
Our faith keeps the darkness 
of hell at bay.

617
01:11:56,145 --> 01:11:59,732
Then use your faith 
to help me find my little girl.

618
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:02,401
Only the demon knows where she is.

619
01:12:02,609 --> 01:12:04,862
Then tell me, 
where do I find this demon?

620
01:12:06,739 --> 01:12:09,199
No one has ever returned 
from the core of the darkness...

621
01:12:09,408 --> 01:12:10,826
...where the demon lies in wait.

622
01:12:11,035 --> 01:12:12,453
She's not gonna help us. 
Let's go.

623
01:12:12,661 --> 01:12:15,205
If you wish to face the demon 
to find your daughter...

624
01:12:15,414 --> 01:12:16,582
...I won't stop you.

625
01:12:16,790 --> 01:12:19,460
- Christabella, they can't go down... 
- Silence, Adam.

626
01:12:23,213 --> 01:12:25,883
Perhaps your faith will protect you.

627
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:28,385
Perhaps not.

628
01:12:42,274 --> 01:12:44,485
If you don't wanna do this...

629
01:12:45,486 --> 01:12:47,488
...I'll understand.

630
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,657
Sharon's adopted...

631
01:12:51,575 --> 01:12:52,785
...but I'm her mother.

632
01:12:52,993 --> 01:12:56,080
I knew that from the moment 
I first laid eyes on her.

633
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:00,292
She's lucky to have you.

634
01:13:01,752 --> 01:13:04,421
Mother is God in the eyes of a child.

635
01:14:15,367 --> 01:14:16,785
Quiet.

636
01:14:17,077 --> 01:14:19,621
We're in his domain now.

637
01:14:25,085 --> 01:14:27,379
Look at this map. Memorize it.

638
01:14:28,380 --> 01:14:30,507
Your memory may save your life.

639
01:14:31,925 --> 01:14:34,887
- Do you see this room? 
- Yeah.

640
01:14:35,053 --> 01:14:37,764
That is where the darkness lies.

641
01:14:37,973 --> 01:14:40,392
The demon is in the bowels 
of this building.

642
01:14:40,559 --> 01:14:42,936
It hides behind the face 
of an innocent.

643
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,438
You mean a child?

644
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:46,899
Don't believe your eyes. 
Your eyes will lie to you.

645
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:50,194
Faith is the only truth.

646
01:14:51,236 --> 01:14:52,446
I will pray for you, Rose...

647
01:14:52,654 --> 01:14:54,990
...but I won't expect you 
and your friend to return.

648
01:14:56,783 --> 01:14:58,327
Goodbye.

649
01:15:00,746 --> 01:15:02,122
Adam.

650
01:15:03,332 --> 01:15:05,834
Left. Right.

651
01:15:06,543 --> 01:15:08,879
Left. Left.

652
01:15:10,088 --> 01:15:14,009
- Right. Right. Left. 
- Take them to the lower level.

653
01:15:14,218 --> 01:15:16,011
- In the basement? 
- Do it, then return.

654
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:18,597
- Left. 3A. 
- But...

655
01:15:18,764 --> 01:15:20,349
- Right. 4A. 
- I said, do it.

656
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:24,686
- Left. Left. Right. 
- Rose. Rose.

657
01:15:25,270 --> 01:15:29,733
- Left. Right. Left. Left. 
- Rose, she's killing you.

658
01:15:29,942 --> 01:15:32,277
- Rose! 
- Let me do this.

659
01:15:33,278 --> 01:15:35,405
I need to do this.

660
01:15:53,465 --> 01:15:55,008
Take this.

661
01:15:55,217 --> 01:15:59,054
They'll be drawn to the light, 
but you won't be able to see without it.

662
01:16:01,890 --> 01:16:03,600
Thank you.

663
01:16:09,982 --> 01:16:12,776
- So this thing actually works? 
- It will.

664
01:16:12,985 --> 01:16:14,945
If the demon wants you, it will.

665
01:16:17,155 --> 01:16:18,365
Forgive me.

666
01:16:19,783 --> 01:16:22,452
We've lived too long as scavengers. 
I believe this is yours.

667
01:16:30,085 --> 01:16:32,796
Witch! Her child's 
the likeness of Alessa.

668
01:16:33,005 --> 01:16:34,339
Her child's the next vessel.

669
01:16:34,506 --> 01:16:37,342
Stop her! 
Don't let the witches go down!

670
01:16:42,180 --> 01:16:43,724
Come on!

671
01:16:53,317 --> 01:16:54,610
Get off her!

672
01:16:56,820 --> 01:16:58,113
Find her.

673
01:16:58,864 --> 01:17:01,491
No! Wait! Cybil!

674
01:17:01,700 --> 01:17:03,827
Cybil! Open the door!

675
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:29,353
No!

676
01:18:58,024 --> 01:18:59,609
8A.

677
01:19:00,152 --> 01:19:04,448
7 A. Right.

678
01:19:14,541 --> 01:19:17,753
Right. 6A.

679
01:19:19,212 --> 01:19:21,131
4A.

680
01:19:22,174 --> 01:19:24,009
3A.

681
01:19:26,636 --> 01:19:29,347
Left, left. Right, right.

682
01:19:29,556 --> 01:19:32,225
Left, left.

683
01:24:42,702 --> 01:24:44,579
The child is mine!

684
01:24:44,788 --> 01:24:46,748
Mine!

685
01:24:52,295 --> 01:24:54,172
She's mine.

686
01:24:55,965 --> 01:24:57,842
She's mine!

687
01:25:21,825 --> 01:25:23,326
Let's go.

688
01:25:26,037 --> 01:25:29,124
Out of the car. Turn around.

689
01:25:44,180 --> 01:25:46,141
Just a friendly warning...

690
01:25:46,724 --> 01:25:49,185
...I'll be back with people 
who know what they're doing.

691
01:25:52,021 --> 01:25:55,733
Before you do that, Chris, 
I wanna tell you about Officer Bennett.

692
01:25:57,360 --> 01:26:00,363
Few years back, some wacko, 
he abducted a kid...

693
01:26:00,572 --> 01:26:03,700
...threw him down a mine vent 
up there in Silent Hill.

694
01:26:04,117 --> 01:26:06,369
Cybil Bennett, she found that boy.

695
01:26:06,578 --> 01:26:08,288
She spent three days 
holding onto him...

696
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:10,665
...keeping him alive 
until they were rescued.

697
01:26:10,874 --> 01:26:12,333
We know what we're doing.

698
01:26:12,542 --> 01:26:14,502
I need to do everything I can.

699
01:26:21,467 --> 01:26:23,261
Let's go.

700
01:26:46,951 --> 01:26:49,162
Please. 
Christabella, let her live.

701
01:26:49,370 --> 01:26:51,581
Your weakness 
led these souls to judgment.

702
01:26:51,789 --> 01:26:54,083
- This time you will bear witness. 
- She is innocent.

703
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:57,253
Look at her. 
She's the whelp of your daughter.

704
01:26:57,462 --> 01:26:58,671
The demon!

705
01:26:59,255 --> 01:27:04,469
The demon fathered this disgusting 
abomination from her child!

706
01:27:04,677 --> 01:27:05,720
No, she's mine!

707
01:27:08,890 --> 01:27:10,934
Sharon. Sharon, look at me.

708
01:27:11,142 --> 01:27:13,728
Look at me. Don't be afraid.

709
01:27:13,937 --> 01:27:16,481
It's okay, it's okay. 
Your mama's coming.

710
01:27:18,191 --> 01:27:21,861
Once again we are called upon 
to restore innocence.

711
01:27:22,070 --> 01:27:25,949
We burn this witch. 
We vanquish evil.

712
01:27:26,866 --> 01:27:29,035
No. You can't. You can't.

713
01:27:29,244 --> 01:27:31,871
- Don't let her say this! No! 
- We burn the child!

714
01:27:32,080 --> 01:27:34,249
We fight the demon!

715
01:27:37,293 --> 01:27:38,544
She's just a child!

716
01:27:38,753 --> 01:27:41,673
What the fuck is wrong 
with you people?

717
01:27:42,131 --> 01:27:44,092
Let her go!

718
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:46,761
Leave her alone!

719
01:27:46,970 --> 01:27:48,596
Leave her alone!

720
01:27:49,305 --> 01:27:51,140
Those who aid the demon...

721
01:27:51,349 --> 01:27:55,144
...they must be cleansed 
by the fire from whence they came.

722
01:27:55,353 --> 01:27:57,939
That's crazy. You're crazy.

723
01:27:58,690 --> 01:28:00,858
No!

724
01:28:01,067 --> 01:28:02,694
Why are you listening to this?

725
01:28:02,902 --> 01:28:05,196
Why?

726
01:28:07,031 --> 01:28:09,993
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her!</i>

727
01:28:10,159 --> 01:28:15,290
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her! 
Burn the witch!</i>

728
01:28:22,338 --> 01:28:24,132
Sharon.

729
01:28:31,347 --> 01:28:33,391
Evil witch!

730
01:28:34,350 --> 01:28:36,311
Suffer.

731
01:28:40,773 --> 01:28:43,401
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her!</i>

732
01:28:43,609 --> 01:28:47,363
<i>Burn the witch! Burn her!</i>

733
01:28:52,785 --> 01:28:55,163
Oh, my God.

734
01:29:02,295 --> 01:29:04,630
You're in your own hell.

735
01:29:12,805 --> 01:29:16,517
Mama, be with me.

736
01:29:39,916 --> 01:29:41,793
Here is where the apocalypse began.

737
01:29:42,001 --> 01:29:44,837
This is where we stopped 
the annihilation of the world.

738
01:29:45,046 --> 01:29:47,507
We drew a line in the sand 
and said:

739
01:29:47,715 --> 01:29:50,176
''Demon, you will not cross!''

740
01:29:50,384 --> 01:29:54,013
But the demon is wicked, 
full of treachery.

741
01:29:54,222 --> 01:29:58,393
Yet again he comes to tempt us 
in the guise of an innocent.

742
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:00,603
To rid the world of this demon...

743
01:30:00,812 --> 01:30:03,439
...we must burn this child!

744
01:30:05,274 --> 01:30:06,359
That's not gonna happen!

745
01:30:10,321 --> 01:30:11,280
Mommy!

746
01:30:12,406 --> 01:30:15,785
It's okay, baby. 
Everything's gonna be okay.

747
01:30:15,993 --> 01:30:17,703
Oh, my God.

748
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:19,080
Oh, my God.

749
01:30:20,206 --> 01:30:22,333
What have you people done?

750
01:30:22,542 --> 01:30:25,795
- You have returned. 
- Yes, I have.

751
01:30:26,420 --> 01:30:28,423
The witch has returned.

752
01:30:31,425 --> 01:30:35,054
Do not believe her lies.

753
01:30:35,471 --> 01:30:37,432
I come from a world 
outside this place.

754
01:30:37,932 --> 01:30:39,684
I come from a world full of life!

755
01:30:43,187 --> 01:30:44,689
Why don't you tell them the truth.

756
01:30:44,897 --> 01:30:48,317
Tell them the truth that you deny, 
even to yourself.

757
01:30:48,526 --> 01:30:50,695
There was no apocalypse!

758
01:30:50,903 --> 01:30:52,905
You burned in the fire 
that you started...

759
01:30:53,114 --> 01:30:56,451
...and nothing can save you 
because you're already damned!

760
01:30:58,286 --> 01:30:59,620
- Mommy! 
- Take her.

761
01:30:59,120 --> 01:31:02,373
Burn her. Burn her as a witch.

762
01:31:02,081 --> 01:31:05,585
Burn her! Burn her!

763
01:31:06,002 --> 01:31:07,295
Demon witch!

764
01:31:07,503 --> 01:31:09,088
- Burn me? 
- Demon witch.

765
01:31:09,297 --> 01:31:11,215
That's your answer.

766
01:31:11,799 --> 01:31:13,759
Burn anything you're afraid of.

767
01:31:13,968 --> 01:31:16,471
Burn anything you can't control.

768
01:31:18,389 --> 01:31:21,809
This woman uses your fear 
to control you.

769
01:31:22,018 --> 01:31:24,562
She led you to burn 
Alessa Gillespie.

770
01:31:24,770 --> 01:31:27,607
She led you to burn 
an innocent child.

771
01:31:27,815 --> 01:31:30,985
But you will not deny your guilt...

772
01:31:31,194 --> 01:31:33,738
...and you cannot deny her pain!

773
01:31:33,946 --> 01:31:37,116
That child was sin incarnate.

774
01:31:37,617 --> 01:31:41,120
No, it's you who have sinned.

775
01:31:42,413 --> 01:31:45,458
You darkened the heart 
of an innocent...

776
01:31:45,666 --> 01:31:49,504
...and now you cower in the face 
of Alessa's revenge.

777
01:31:49,712 --> 01:31:51,672
- Sinner. 
- Heresy.

778
01:31:51,881 --> 01:31:53,925
Burn her. Burn her!

779
01:31:55,259 --> 01:31:59,305
Your faith brings death!

780
01:32:00,681 --> 01:32:02,600
You are alone in this limbo...

781
01:32:02,808 --> 01:32:05,561
...and God is not here.

782
01:32:06,979 --> 01:32:08,022
Mommy!

783
01:32:21,410 --> 01:32:25,456
She was a blasphemer.

784
01:32:26,290 --> 01:32:28,709
Blasphemer!

785
01:32:31,712 --> 01:32:33,548
Blasphemer!

786
01:33:49,123 --> 01:33:50,875
What have you done?

787
01:33:51,792 --> 01:33:53,711
You've brought the darkness in 
with you.

788
01:33:54,795 --> 01:33:56,839
Do you know what you've done?

789
01:34:05,973 --> 01:34:07,892
For Sharon.

790
01:34:12,605 --> 01:34:14,273
Mommy.

791
01:34:14,482 --> 01:34:17,360
Mommy. Mommy.

792
01:35:24,635 --> 01:35:27,138
No! No!

793
01:35:55,958 --> 01:36:00,087
Alessa, what have you become?

794
01:36:14,143 --> 01:36:16,061
Mommy!

795
01:36:17,313 --> 01:36:20,733
Sharon! Sharon, honey, it's me. 
It's Mommy.

796
01:36:42,004 --> 01:36:43,339
Down! We're getting down.

797
01:36:43,506 --> 01:36:45,966
Shut your eyes. 
Shut your eyes, baby.

798
01:36:47,009 --> 01:36:48,719
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

799
01:36:57,520 --> 01:36:59,730
Shut your eyes. Shut your eyes.

800
01:36:59,939 --> 01:37:03,442
It's just a bad dream. 
It's just a bad dream.

801
01:38:31,989 --> 01:38:33,824
I love you.

802
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:43,394
<i>- Hi, this is Chris. 
- And this is Rose.</i>

803
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:45,396
<i>And I'm Sharon Da Silva.</i>

804
01:39:45,562 --> 01:39:47,982
<i>Please leave a message!</i>

805
01:39:49,900 --> 01:39:52,528
Christopher, it's me.

806
01:39:53,112 --> 01:39:54,363
I'm with Sharon.

807
01:39:56,490 --> 01:40:01,245
Hello? Hello? Rose?

808
01:40:03,122 --> 01:40:05,708
Yeah. We're coming home.
