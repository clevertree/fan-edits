1
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:25,126
<i>They are an army unlike any other...</i>

2
00:01:25,168 --> 00:01:29,005
<i>crusading across the stars 
toward a place called UnderVerse,</i>

3
00:01:29,089 --> 00:01:31,007
<i>their promised land...</i>

4
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:34,385
<i>a constellation of dark new worlds.</i>

5
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:36,888
<i>Necromongers, they're called.</i>

6
00:01:36,971 --> 00:01:41,351
<i>And if they cannot convert you, 
they will kill you.</i>

7
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,980
<i>Leading them, the Lord Marshal.</i>

8
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:50,151
<i>He alone has made a pilgrimage 
to the gates of the UnderVerse...</i>

9
00:01:50,193 --> 00:01:53,446
<i>and returned a different being.</i>

10
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:56,783
<i>Stronger. Stranger.</i>

11
00:01:56,866 --> 00:02:00,161
<i>Half alive and half...</i>

12
00:02:00,203 --> 00:02:02,956
<i>something else.</i>

13
00:02:46,332 --> 00:02:50,753
Linin' him up for you. Port-side 
shot comin' up. Steady. Here we go.

14
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:00,763
Steady.

15
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:03,892
<i>Take it. Take it!</i>

16
00:03:03,933 --> 00:03:06,394
Take the shot!

17
00:03:08,479 --> 00:03:11,107
Shit! 
Toombs, we're runnin' out of road!

18
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:13,401
Shut up! I got it! Again!

19
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,740
Now!

20
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:20,909
Toombs!

21
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,593
Riddick.

22
00:03:50,355 --> 00:03:54,734
<i>Three meters clearance port-side. 
One and a half meters starboard.</i>

23
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,278
We got a choke point comin' up.

24
00:04:09,832 --> 00:04:12,335
<i>What the shit was that?</i>

25
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:17,298
Tags, you got eyes on Riddick?

26
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,176
Tags?

27
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:26,265
Jesus.

28
00:04:26,349 --> 00:04:29,269
He just ghosted two guys, 
and I never even saw him.

29
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,231
What do you think, Toombs? 
I mean, maybe we oughta just...

30
00:04:33,398 --> 00:04:34,732
I think you're my new gunner.

31
00:04:35,108 --> 00:04:36,943
Grab a Gat.

32
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:46,494
Stay on top of him this time.

33
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:18,067
<i>You made three mistakes.</i>

34
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:23,114
First, you took the job.

35
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:25,199
Second, you came light.

36
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:29,871
<i>A four-man crew for me? 
Fuckin' insulting.</i>

37
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:33,082
<i>But the worst mistake you made...</i>

38
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,128
<i>Empty gun rack.</i>

39
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:44,886
- What's the bounty on my head? 
- One mil.

40
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:52,226
- One-point-five. 
- What slam pays 1.5 for a convict?

41
00:05:52,310 --> 00:05:54,562
Private party.

42
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:57,607
Hey, hey, hey, hey! 
Guy, guy! Easy! Anonymous.

43
00:05:57,648 --> 00:06:01,027
- That's what the sheet said. 
- What planet?

44
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:04,364
Helion Prime.

45
00:06:11,621 --> 00:06:14,582
Whoa. Where you going'? 
Last question.

46
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:18,294
And you better get this one right, merc.

47
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:20,296
Whose ship is this?

48
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:22,882
Mine?

49
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,509
Wrong Answer

50
00:06:43,528 --> 00:06:46,030
<i>Knew they'd come for me.</i>

51
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:49,075
<i>Took 'em five years, but I knew.</i>

52
00:06:49,158 --> 00:06:53,830
<i>You don't expect these mercs 
to have any honor, any code.</i>

53
00:06:55,581 --> 00:06:59,961
<i>But this new bounty from a holy man,</i>

54
00:07:00,044 --> 00:07:03,005
<i>a guy whose neck I saved...</i>

55
00:07:04,465 --> 00:07:06,384
<i>Well, lesson learned.</i>

56
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:09,178
<i>No such word as "friend. "</i>

57
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:12,515
<i>It can only end bad 
when you let someone get too close.</i>

58
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:15,893
<i>Bad for them.</i>

59
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:19,313
<i>So now it's back to civilization</i>

60
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:23,151
<i> all the brightness... 
and everything I hate.</i>

61
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,655
Just wanted to be left alone

62
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:31,409
<i>Helion Prime is on alert condition four.</i>

63
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:41,252
<i>Unrecognized craft. You need to follow me 
to Spaceport Six for security inspections.</i>

64
00:07:41,335 --> 00:07:44,589
<i>Hey! Do you hear me?</i>

65
00:07:44,630 --> 00:07:47,300
<i>Follow me to Spaceport Six now!</i>

66
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,685
Imam, pray for us.

67
00:08:39,769 --> 00:08:43,022
<i>It was confirmed 
two seasons back. Yes.</i>

68
00:08:43,105 --> 00:08:45,441
<i>They're coming here. 
I mean, are we next?</i>

69
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,485
<i>Militants storm...</i>

70
00:08:47,568 --> 00:08:50,696
<i>Yes. But going to the underground 
shelters if it happens...</i>

71
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:52,990
<i>You're right. 
That's what I thought too.</i>

72
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:55,535
<i>Are you staying or leaving?</i>

73
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:57,912
<i>It's the end of everything. 
Everything!</i>

74
00:08:57,995 --> 00:09:01,457
<i>Well, my neighbours... 
Half my street is gone.</i>

75
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:03,459
What are we gonna do? 
I don't know. I don't know.

76
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,461
<i>Hood of the devil. 
That's what someone called 'em.</i>

77
00:09:05,545 --> 00:09:07,630
Them? Who is them? 
Some kind of new creature...

78
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,674
This is nonsense. 
It's all nonsense.

79
00:09:09,757 --> 00:09:13,678
<i>So tall that it touches the clouds.</i>

80
00:09:13,719 --> 00:09:18,099
And there's nothing around this 
statue, this colossus. Nothing left.

81
00:09:18,182 --> 00:09:20,393
It's their calling card.

82
00:09:30,903 --> 00:09:34,073
<i>Did you know all your doors were locked?</i>

83
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:41,539
<i>Five years ago,</i>

84
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:44,500
<i>I took two people off that planet...</i>

85
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:48,796
<i>A kid, Jack, 
who everyone else thought was a boy,</i>

86
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,549
<i>and a holy man...</i>

87
00:09:51,632 --> 00:09:53,593
<i>searching for New Mecca.</i>

88
00:09:56,429 --> 00:10:01,183
<i>I told one man...</i>

89
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:04,437
where I might go.

90
00:10:04,478 --> 00:10:08,441
I showed trust to one man.

91
00:10:08,482 --> 00:10:11,986
Did I make a mistake, Imam?

92
00:10:12,069 --> 00:10:14,405
There is no simple answer.

93
00:10:14,488 --> 00:10:19,160
Whatever was said 
was meant to give us a chance...

94
00:10:19,243 --> 00:10:21,245
a fighting chance.

95
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:25,124
Were it not for the threat of invasion, 
I never would have betrayed you.

96
00:10:26,751 --> 00:10:30,880
So now who do I have to kill 
to get this payday off my head?

97
00:10:46,771 --> 00:10:51,317
<i>It is said the comet 
always precedes them...</i>

98
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,861
these world-enders.

99
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,907
The Coalsack planets are gone.

100
00:10:57,948 --> 00:11:00,785
<i>Eight million settlers missing.</i>

101
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:04,497
<i>The entire Aquilan System is gone too.</i>

102
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:08,959
Helion Prime shares its sunlight 
with all worlds nearby.

103
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:15,800
If we fall, they fall.

104
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,219
And after that...

105
00:11:18,260 --> 00:11:21,430
My God, 
how do I save my family?

106
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:28,604
<i>Have you heard anything I've said?</i>

107
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:34,568
You said it's all circling the 
drain... the whole universe.

108
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,570
<i>- Right? 
- That's right.</i>

109
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,748
Had to end sometime.

110
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,309
The one you want is now here.

111
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,705
And whose throat is this?

112
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:33,377
If you cut my throat, I'll not be able to 
rescind the offer that brought you here.

113
00:12:33,461 --> 00:12:35,963
Nor tell you why it's so vital 
that you did come.

114
00:12:36,046 --> 00:12:38,966
The blade comes off 
when the bounty comes off.

115
00:12:39,008 --> 00:12:42,636
This is Aereon, 
an envoy from the Elemental race.

116
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,097
She means you no harm.

117
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,646
There are very few of us who have met 
a Necromonger and lived to speak of it.

118
00:12:52,938 --> 00:12:54,774
Necromonger.

119
00:12:54,857 --> 00:13:00,154
It is the name that will convert 
or kill every last human life...

120
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:01,405
<i>There is a story, Riddick, 
of young male Furyans...</i>

121
00:13:01,405 --> 00:13:03,073
<i>There is a story, Riddick, 
of young male Furyans...</i>

122
00:13:03,073 --> 00:13:05,075
<i>There is a story, Riddick, 
of young male Furyans...</i>

123
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,661
strangled at birth...

124
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:09,955
strangled with their own cords.

125
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:14,293
When Aereon told this story 
to the Helion leaders,

126
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:16,462
I told her of you.

127
00:13:16,545 --> 00:13:19,632
- What do you know of your early years? 
- Do you remember your home world?

128
00:13:19,715 --> 00:13:22,176
- Where it was? 
- Have you met any others?

129
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:24,261
Others like yourself.

130
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:30,935
Sister, they don't know 
what to do with just one of me.

131
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,479
<i>Open up in there!</i>

132
00:13:33,562 --> 00:13:35,189
<i>- Stand back! 
- Open up!</i>

133
00:13:35,189 --> 00:13:39,568
I will send them away. 
But wait one minute, please.

134
00:13:38,692 --> 00:13:42,780
<i>Will you wait one minute 
to save worlds?</i>

135
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,243
Not my fight.

136
00:13:47,284 --> 00:13:49,578
So, you will leave us 
to our fate,

137
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,956
<i>just like you did her.</i>

138
00:13:52,039 --> 00:13:55,251
<i>Break it down!</i>

139
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,087
Get him!

140
00:13:58,170 --> 00:14:00,506
Come. Let us try to send them away.

141
00:14:03,968 --> 00:14:06,220
<i>Move it. Come on. 
Leave us alone!</i>

142
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:11,850
There is no one here!

143
00:14:11,934 --> 00:14:15,729
<i>You don't understand. 
He can help us! He can help us!</i>

144
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:20,901
<i>Go!</i>

145
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,243
You're not afraid of the dark, are you?

146
00:14:49,638 --> 00:14:52,182
<i>- Get him! 
- Where is he?</i>

147
00:14:52,266 --> 00:14:54,602
In there!

148
00:15:21,545 --> 00:15:24,048
You mentioned her.

149
00:15:24,131 --> 00:15:27,009
She, uh...

150
00:15:27,051 --> 00:15:29,011
She went looking for you.

151
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:32,473
People died. 
She went to prison.

152
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:36,352
I... I don't remember where.

153
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:42,816
But it was a world so hot 
you could not survive on the surface.

154
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:46,362
- Crematoria. 
- Young Jack.

155
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:48,656
She thought of you 
as her older brother.

156
00:15:48,739 --> 00:15:51,742
- She worshipped you. 
- You were supposed to watch her.

157
00:15:52,910 --> 00:15:55,537
<i>She never forgave you...</i>

158
00:15:55,621 --> 00:15:58,082
for leaving just when 
she needed you most.

159
00:15:59,083 --> 00:16:02,961
She needed to stay away 
from me.

160
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,839
You all do

161
00:16:14,223 --> 00:16:18,018
Furyans. 
Defiant to the end.

162
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:57,725
No, no.

163
00:16:57,808 --> 00:17:00,310
We go to the shelter.

164
00:17:00,394 --> 00:17:02,855
We take only ourselves.

165
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:26,003
Stay close.

166
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:01,080
<i>No!</i>

167
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,862
<i>Flight leaders, get all squads 
off the ground now.</i>

168
00:19:14,945 --> 00:19:17,781
<i>We have heavy inbound.</i>

169
00:19:18,866 --> 00:19:20,993
<i>Follow me in!</i>

170
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,388
The next shelter. 
This way!

171
00:19:41,471 --> 00:19:43,473
Yeah!

172
00:19:43,557 --> 00:19:45,934
<i>Whoo-hoo!</i>

173
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:10,208
I'll see if it's safe.

174
00:20:15,422 --> 00:20:18,926
- Stay back! 
- Come, Ziza.

175
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,071
Come!

176
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,587
Lajjun and Ziza!

177
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:40,340
- When it's over. 
- Let me go. I must get to my family!

178
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,759
When it's over.

179
00:22:10,704 --> 00:22:12,706
Aah!

180
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,237
In here.

181
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:47,741
Get in.

182
00:22:49,451 --> 00:22:51,661
Shh.

183
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,437
<i>- Imam! 
- Don't follow me.</i>

184
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,992
There will be 
an afterlife for me.

185
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:39,579
Will there be for you?

186
00:26:57,532 --> 00:27:01,077
Let's go replenish the ranks.

187
00:27:35,362 --> 00:27:38,615
In this 'verse,

188
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:42,786
life is antagonistic 
to the natural state.

189
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:49,376
<i>Here, humans in all 
their various races...</i>

190
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:52,587
are a spontaneous outbreak...

191
00:27:52,670 --> 00:27:54,839
an unguided mistake.

192
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:56,925
Our purpose...

193
00:27:57,008 --> 00:28:00,804
is to correct that mistake.

194
00:28:02,013 --> 00:28:05,308
Because there is another 'verse...

195
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:10,397
a 'verse where life 
is welcomed and cherished.

196
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:16,277
<i>A ravishing, ever-new place 
called UnderVerse.</i>

197
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:23,118
<i>So it is this 'verse 
that must be cleansed of life,</i>

198
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:27,455
so that UnderVerse 
can populate and prosper.

199
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:34,629
<i>Look around you. 
Every Necromonger in this hall,</i>

200
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:39,134
every one of the Legion Vast that just 
swept aside your defenses in one night...

201
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:41,970
was once like you.

202
00:28:42,011 --> 00:28:44,764
Fought as feebly as you.

203
00:28:45,849 --> 00:28:48,768
Every Necromonger 
that lives today...

204
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,979
is a convert.

205
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:56,234
- There'll be no conversions! 
- We all began as something else!

206
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:02,949
It was hard for me to accept, too, 
when I first heard these words.

207
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:05,618
But I changed.

208
00:29:05,702 --> 00:29:07,120
I let them take away my pain.

209
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:12,292
- You betrayed your faith! 
- Just as you will change...

210
00:29:12,375 --> 00:29:17,797
<i>when you realize that the threshold 
to the UnderVerse will be crossed...</i>

211
00:29:17,881 --> 00:29:22,051
<i>only by those who have 
embraced the Necromonger faith.</i>

212
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:25,263
For those of you 
who will right now...

213
00:29:25,346 --> 00:29:29,392
drop to your knees 
and ask to be purified.

214
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:33,021
- We will not renounce our faith! 
- No one here will do what you ask.

215
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:35,899
It is unthinkable!

216
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:41,321
<i>This is a world of many peoples, 
many religions!</i>

217
00:29:41,404 --> 00:29:45,783
And we simply cannot 
and will not be converted!

218
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,661
Then I'll take your soul.

219
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:02,550
<i>Join him...</i>

220
00:30:02,634 --> 00:30:05,845
Or join me.

221
00:30:25,782 --> 00:30:28,409
This is your one chance.

222
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,954
Take the Lord Marshal's offer 
and bow.

223
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,873
I bow to no man.

224
00:30:41,047 --> 00:30:43,091
He's not a man.

225
00:30:43,132 --> 00:30:46,803
He's the holy Half-Dead 
who has seen the UnderVerse.

226
00:30:46,886 --> 00:30:49,389
Look, I'm not 
with everyone here.

227
00:30:49,472 --> 00:30:52,058
But I will take a piece of him.

228
00:30:58,648 --> 00:31:00,608
A piece you will have.

229
00:31:28,636 --> 00:31:30,638
<i>Stop him!</i>

230
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,486
Irgun. One of my best.

231
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:48,031
If you say so.

232
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,995
What do you think of this blade?

233
00:32:03,755 --> 00:32:06,132
I think it's a half-gram heavy 
on the back end.

234
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:08,176
In our faith,

235
00:32:08,217 --> 00:32:10,386
you keep what you kill.

236
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:19,729
Are you familiar to me?

237
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:26,069
Have we met 
on some distant field?

238
00:32:27,236 --> 00:32:28,988
You'd think I'd remember.

239
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:33,785
You'd think I would too.

240
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:37,413
Take him before the Quasi-Deads.

241
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,084
Beautiful eyes.

242
00:33:23,126 --> 00:33:25,128
Come.

243
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:31,968
The last six Lord Marshals 
have called this home.

244
00:33:32,051 --> 00:33:34,303
Magnificent, isn't it?

245
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:38,141
- I might have gone a different way. 
- True of us all.

246
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:44,272
<i>Converts receiving the mark 
of the Necromonger.</i>

247
00:33:46,482 --> 00:33:49,777
They learn how one pain 
can lessen another.

248
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,877
There now.

249
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:10,840
That is just... perfect.

250
00:34:14,218 --> 00:34:17,430
The more you resist them,

251
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:19,849
the greater the damage will be.

252
00:34:22,435 --> 00:34:25,480
<i>A new one.</i>

253
00:34:25,521 --> 00:34:28,316
<i>You've brought us a new one.</i>

254
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,624
Interesting breeder.

255
00:35:00,681 --> 00:35:03,309
<i>Making entry.</i>

256
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:08,815
<i>We've entered his neocortex.</i>

257
00:35:08,898 --> 00:35:12,735
<i>- Ahh! The Riddick! 
- Regress.</i>

258
00:35:12,819 --> 00:35:16,447
<i>Scanning fresh memories.</i>

259
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,575
<i>Thoughts of someone called Jack.</i>

260
00:35:19,617 --> 00:35:21,536
Riddick!

261
00:35:23,538 --> 00:35:26,374
<i>Now we find thoughts of an Elemental.</i>

262
00:35:26,457 --> 00:35:29,627
<i>The one race that would slow 
the spread of Necromongers.</i>

263
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:31,963
<i>- Furyans. 
- Furyans.</i>

264
00:35:37,301 --> 00:35:39,470
Where does he come from?

265
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:44,016
Who are his people? 
These are the things I need to know.

266
00:35:46,018 --> 00:35:48,896
<i>We find energy.</i>

267
00:35:50,439 --> 00:35:55,194
<i>We find Furyan energy.</i>

268
00:35:55,444 --> 00:35:56,571
<i>-He's Furyan!</i>

269
00:35:57,989 --> 00:36:00,074
<i>Furyan!</i>

270
00:36:01,784 --> 00:36:04,412
<i>A Furyan survivor!</i>

271
00:36:04,954 --> 00:36:07,748
<i>Kill the Furyan! Kill the Riddick!</i>

272
00:36:07,832 --> 00:36:10,793
<i>Kill the Riddick! Kill the Riddick! 
Kill the Riddick!</i>

273
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,337
Kill the Riddick.

274
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:50,207
Find him. Whatever it takes. Find him!

275
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:29,080
Let me guess. 
A five-man crew this time.

276
00:37:30,081 --> 00:37:32,375
Couple of things 
you could have done better.

277
00:37:36,712 --> 00:37:41,342
First, trash the locator beacon 
inside my ship... the one you jacked.

278
00:37:41,425 --> 00:37:44,762
<i>And second... and this is really 
the more important part...</i>

279
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:48,057
dust my dick 
when you get the chance.

280
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:51,894
- Any questions? 
- Yeah.

281
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:56,065
What took you so long?

282
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:23,009
<i>Decoy launched.</i>

283
00:38:23,259 --> 00:38:27,388
In and out, unsuspected and undetected. 
Damn, I love a good smash-and-grab.

284
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:27,680
Not so fast. Not so fast.

285
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:31,892
<i>- Preparing to engage ion drive. 
- So,</i>

286
00:38:31,934 --> 00:38:35,855
where do we drop 
your merc-killin' ass?

287
00:38:35,938 --> 00:38:38,232
<i>Who's gonna pay 
the most for you now?</i>

288
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:42,069
- Butcher Bay? 
- Butcher Bay.

289
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,905
Ten minutes every other day 
on the dog run.

290
00:38:44,947 --> 00:38:47,950
Protein waffles aren't bad.

291
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:51,871
Hey, how 'bout Ursa Luna? 
Nice little double-max prison.

292
00:38:51,954 --> 00:38:56,334
They keep a cell open for me... 
just in case I drop in.

293
00:38:56,417 --> 00:38:58,336
<i>You know the problem 
with these joints now?</i>

294
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,380
Health clubs 
for waffle-eatin' pussies.

295
00:39:01,464 --> 00:39:04,175
Maybe we should think about 
uppin' our game here a little bit.

296
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:06,635
Think about someplace 
truly diabolical.

297
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,679
What the hell is he thinkin' now?

298
00:39:08,763 --> 00:39:11,265
<i>He's thinkin' a triple-max prison.</i>

299
00:39:11,348 --> 00:39:14,727
<i>A no-daylight slam. 
Only three of 'em left in this system...</i>

300
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:19,106
two of 'em outta range for a shitty little 
under cutter like this one with no legs.

301
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:22,735
Leavin' just... one...

302
00:39:22,818 --> 00:39:25,738
Crematoria.

303
00:39:25,780 --> 00:39:28,616
That is what you had in mind, 
right, Toombs?

304
00:39:28,657 --> 00:39:31,160
Hey, how does he know where we're goin', 
and we don't?

305
00:39:31,619 --> 00:39:32,328
Dope it out.

306
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,496
I hate this run.

307
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:35,456
Just do it!

308
00:39:35,873 --> 00:39:37,875
Don't know about this 
new crew of yours.

309
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,086
They seem a bit skittish.

310
00:39:40,377 --> 00:39:44,882
Probably shouldn't tell 'em 
what happened to the last crew.

311
00:39:52,598 --> 00:39:57,103
You know, you supposed 
to be some slick-shit killer.

312
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:59,688
Now look at you...

313
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:02,942
all back-of-the-bus 
and shit.

314
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,189
<i>I say we attack Helion Two next.</i>

315
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:44,191
Take it straight 
into their teeth.

316
00:40:44,233 --> 00:40:47,653
It'll cost you 20,000 heads, five 
warrior ships. Nothing more, I swear it.

317
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:51,031
While I do prize brute force,

318
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:54,243
this approach 
is perhaps more artful.

319
00:40:54,326 --> 00:40:57,163
Start at the end.

320
00:40:57,246 --> 00:40:59,206
Go straight to Helion Five,

321
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,500
the last planet 
in the system.

322
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:04,211
We approach from the night side.

323
00:41:04,253 --> 00:41:07,256
<i>Remove these cannon first,</i>

324
00:41:07,298 --> 00:41:10,134
then attack 
the larger placements at speed.

325
00:41:10,217 --> 00:41:13,012
<i>We'll catch them on their rear flank. 
And in ten days' time,</i>

326
00:41:13,095 --> 00:41:17,391
<i>the rest of those worlds 
will tumble before us.</i>

327
00:41:17,475 --> 00:41:19,810
You see, as with most, 
their blind spot...

328
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:22,188
is right behind them.

329
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:27,818
I've located an ion trail 
which leads off-world.

330
00:41:27,902 --> 00:41:30,571
Then you should be 
off-world, Vaako.

331
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:33,240
I've deployed a tracker team. 
One of the best.

332
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,077
Wherever Riddick has gone, 
you lens him out and cleanse him.

333
00:41:38,037 --> 00:41:38,787
You.

334
00:41:38,787 --> 00:41:41,957
You want me to take a 
frigate for one breeder?

335
00:41:42,124 --> 00:41:44,168
Don't question it, Vaako!

336
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:49,256
Take it on faith.

337
00:41:52,009 --> 00:41:57,223
<i>Mercenaries, Elementals, 
Necromongers...</i>

338
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,059
<i>Shit, I've never been so popular.</i>

339
00:42:01,352 --> 00:42:05,564
<i>Should probably slip these chains 
and open up a few arteries.</i>

340
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,485
<i>But why drive, 
when you can get driven?</i>

341
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:13,405
<i>A free ticket to Crematoria. 
Thanks, Toombs.</i>

342
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:17,368
<i>Got me some business there 
named Jack.</i>

343
00:42:18,285 --> 00:42:23,040
<i>And once we settle up, 
I'll walk away forever.</i>

344
00:42:23,165 --> 00:42:26,794
<i>So, I'll just wait, all back-of-the-bus.</i>

345
00:42:27,711 --> 00:42:29,380
<i>For now.</i>

346
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:47,606
- How unexpected. 
- An Elemental.

347
00:42:47,648 --> 00:42:51,277
<i>- Here? 
- One of the captives.</i>

348
00:42:51,318 --> 00:42:54,280
<i>And why, after 30 years,</i>

349
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:56,573
should it be you?

350
00:42:56,782 --> 00:42:59,535
You be the good warrior.

351
00:42:59,618 --> 00:43:02,496
Go after this Riddick.

352
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:06,208
I'll find out why the Lord Marshal 
is so threatened by him.

353
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:20,389
<i>Destination reached.</i>

354
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:22,391
<i>Unlocking manual controls.</i>

355
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:25,811
All right. I make 700 degrees 
on the day side,

356
00:43:24,977 --> 00:43:27,855
300 below on the night side.

357
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,899
Let's not get caught in the sun.

358
00:43:30,983 --> 00:43:33,402
If I owned this place and hell,

359
00:43:33,485 --> 00:43:36,447
I'd rent this place out 
and live in hell.

360
00:43:45,205 --> 00:43:47,625
<i>- Blue angle... good. 
- Stand by.</i>

361
00:43:49,126 --> 00:43:51,086
<i>And...</i>

362
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,130
<i>Plotted course good.</i>

363
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:55,591
Hit it!

364
00:43:55,674 --> 00:43:59,470
<i>Angle of approach, not good.</i>

365
00:44:06,852 --> 00:44:09,521
<i>Look, Ma. No hands!</i>

366
00:44:43,972 --> 00:44:45,891
Party poppers!

367
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,707
I think I shit myself.

368
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:15,087
Skittish, Toombs. Very skittish.

369
00:45:36,608 --> 00:45:38,569
Comfy?

370
00:45:56,003 --> 00:45:59,381
When the ride's over,

371
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:02,009
your goggles are mine.

372
00:46:30,579 --> 00:46:33,624
Four-way split!

373
00:46:43,967 --> 00:46:46,261
29.4 kilometers.

374
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:59,107
So, this is Riddick.

375
00:47:23,757 --> 00:47:27,803
What in the bowels of Christ 
are you talkin' about, 700K?

376
00:47:27,886 --> 00:47:29,763
Don't take this one, boss.

377
00:47:29,846 --> 00:47:33,141
See? Anatoli here 
has a nose for trouble.

378
00:47:33,225 --> 00:47:35,561
And this one, this Riddick guy...

379
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:37,729
Big, big trouble.

380
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:40,941
So, 700,000 is good money.

381
00:47:41,024 --> 00:47:44,778
I'd take the money, Toombs.

382
00:47:52,494 --> 00:47:57,040
<i>The guild pays us a caretaker's fee 
for each prisoner each year.</i>

383
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:01,128
We pay mercs 20% of that total fee 
based on a certain life expectancy.

384
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:02,838
<i>How's about this?</i>

385
00:48:02,921 --> 00:48:05,841
You open that safe you got hidden 
behind the console there,

386
00:48:05,924 --> 00:48:10,053
show me the real books, 
then we figure out my cut.

387
00:48:10,095 --> 00:48:12,097
Then I'll be on my way.

388
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:20,355
Open my books. 
This is what you suggest?

389
00:48:25,402 --> 00:48:27,362
Wasn't a suggestion.

390
00:48:45,255 --> 00:48:49,968
<i>These are dangerous days, 
if you believe the talk.</i>

391
00:48:50,969 --> 00:48:54,014
- Talk? 
- About dead planets.

392
00:48:54,097 --> 00:48:57,225
About some ghost army.

393
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,937
About them.

394
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:03,482
"Them"?

395
00:49:20,248 --> 00:49:22,167
I'll run the numbers again.

396
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:24,336
It takes a couple of days, 
probably,

397
00:49:24,419 --> 00:49:27,798
so you can stay as my guest.

398
00:49:27,881 --> 00:49:29,841
At least here, we are all safe.

399
00:49:29,883 --> 00:49:33,178
<i>- Yes? 
- Yes, boss.</i>

400
00:49:33,261 --> 00:49:35,639
I'll give it a day.

401
00:49:38,016 --> 00:49:40,143
One.

402
00:50:18,557 --> 00:50:20,517
<i>There are inmates...</i>

403
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,311
<i>and there are convicts.</i>

404
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:26,815
A convict has a certain code.

405
00:50:26,898 --> 00:50:30,861
And he knows to show 
a certain respect.

406
00:50:31,903 --> 00:50:34,448
<i>An inmate, on the other hand,</i>

407
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:37,033
pulls the pin on his fellow man.

408
00:50:37,117 --> 00:50:39,536
<i>Does the guards' work for them.</i>

409
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:42,205
Brings shame...

410
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,624
To the game.

411
00:50:46,626 --> 00:50:49,588
So, which are you gonna be?

412
00:50:49,671 --> 00:50:52,215
Me?

413
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:56,595
I'm just passin' through.

414
00:51:02,434 --> 00:51:04,561
Welcome to Crematoria.

415
00:51:25,290 --> 00:51:29,961
They can be quite a test, 
these deep runs...

416
00:51:31,797 --> 00:51:33,965
tests of our inner selves.

417
00:51:36,301 --> 00:51:38,678
Don't you find that true?

418
00:51:42,641 --> 00:51:44,643
Some men do.

419
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,605
<i>Just being so far from the armada,</i>

420
00:51:48,647 --> 00:51:54,528
the mind can start to fill 
with strange thoughts, doubts.

421
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:57,531
Don't you ever have doubts, Vaako?

422
00:52:00,992 --> 00:52:03,453
- Doubts? 
- About the campaign.

423
00:52:04,496 --> 00:52:06,623
About Lord Marshal.

424
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:13,004
First and always, 
I am a Necromonger commander.

425
00:52:14,089 --> 00:52:19,177
So if you're here to test my loyalty, 
you succeed only in testing my patience.

426
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:22,848
Oh, no. 
No, that's not why I'm here at all.

427
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:32,440
<i>A young warrior 
once consulted a seer.</i>

428
00:52:33,441 --> 00:52:38,488
<i>He was told a child would be born 
on the planet Furya... a male child...</i>

429
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:41,783
<i>who would someday 
cause the warrior's downfall.</i>

430
00:52:41,783 --> 00:52:45,162
<i>Cause his untimed death.</i>

431
00:52:46,162 --> 00:52:51,126
Furya? Furya's a ruined world. 
No life to speak of.

432
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:52,752
For good reason.

433
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:57,841
This young warrior 
mounted an attack on Furya,

434
00:52:57,883 --> 00:53:01,011
killing all young males 
he could find,

435
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:05,182
even strangling some 
with their birth cords.

436
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:08,018
An artful stroke, 
wouldn't you say?

437
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:13,982
So this warrior, the one who tried to 
outwit the prediction, would later become...

438
00:53:14,065 --> 00:53:16,067
That's why he worries.

439
00:53:16,151 --> 00:53:18,153
...our Lord Marshal.

440
00:53:19,738 --> 00:53:21,740
Which would make 
the man-child...

441
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,284
He worries he missed 
killing that child in its crib.

442
00:53:24,367 --> 00:53:26,369
...Riddick.

443
00:54:20,256 --> 00:54:22,676
Feeding time!

444
00:54:29,933 --> 00:54:32,560
Here they come!

445
00:55:35,081 --> 00:55:38,418
Aaah!

446
00:57:03,503 --> 00:57:05,505
It's an animal thing.

447
00:57:12,303 --> 00:57:15,432
Let's pop the cork. 
Get some fresh air.

448
00:57:52,552 --> 00:57:54,637
So they do go topside...

449
00:57:56,055 --> 00:57:58,808
to swap out air.

450
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,311
Interesting.

451
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,104
Who the hell are you?

452
00:58:05,064 --> 00:58:08,443
When it happens, it'll happen fast.

453
00:58:08,526 --> 00:58:11,988
<i>Stay on my leg when I cut fence 
or stay here...</i>

454
00:58:12,030 --> 00:58:14,032
for the rest of your unnatural life.

455
00:58:14,115 --> 00:58:17,952
Nobody outs this place. 
Nobody.

456
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:26,336
<i>He ain't "nobody. "</i>

457
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:44,771
<i>Good news first. 
Talked things over with my amigos here.</i>

458
00:58:44,854 --> 00:58:48,066
We'll cut you in for 775K.

459
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:52,570
Well, all right.

460
00:58:52,654 --> 00:58:54,989
What's the bad news? 
They close the local whorehouse?

461
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:01,454
<i>No. The bad news is worse than that. 
Much worse.</i>

462
00:59:01,537 --> 00:59:06,542
Our pilot, he saw this. 
It crossed a shipping lane.

463
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:13,591
<i>Any idea what this might be?</i>

464
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:20,181
Never saw nothin' like it.

465
00:59:20,265 --> 00:59:23,977
<i>This ship charts back 
to Helion Prime.</i>

466
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,564
You know, Anatoli's 
got a nose for trouble,

467
00:59:27,647 --> 00:59:30,775
<i>and he thinks 
trouble follows you here.</i>

468
00:59:33,820 --> 00:59:38,157
<i>Look. We dusted our tracks 
and got the hell outta there.</i>

469
00:59:38,199 --> 00:59:41,202
There is no way 
we didn't lose them.

470
00:59:42,370 --> 00:59:45,248
"Them"?

471
00:59:50,712 --> 00:59:53,923
This is my prisoner. Mine.

472
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:56,009
Nobody else's.

473
00:59:56,092 --> 00:59:58,386
And I want my money now.

474
00:59:58,469 --> 01:00:00,555
<i>So...</i>

475
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:03,057
you stole a prisoner...

476
01:00:03,141 --> 01:00:05,143
from "them"?

477
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:14,587
No.

478
01:01:14,671 --> 01:01:17,757
<i>Riddick. No!</i>

479
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:26,933
Shoulda taken the money, Toombs.

480
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,450
You gonna kill me?

481
01:02:58,774 --> 01:03:00,985
<i>Mercs.</i>

482
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,906
Some guards here, 
but this can't be all of them.

483
01:03:06,115 --> 01:03:09,410
<i>Check their slots in the back... 
and be careful.</i>

484
01:03:09,494 --> 01:03:10,578
<i>Don't bother.</i>

485
01:03:11,579 --> 01:03:13,956
Guards ain't there.

486
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,751
<i>They figured out the Necros 
are comin' for me.</i>

487
01:03:16,834 --> 01:03:20,004
Plan was to clean the bank, 
ghost the mercs,

488
01:03:20,087 --> 01:03:22,006
break wide through the tunnel.

489
01:03:22,089 --> 01:03:25,801
And then somebody got a lucky shot off 
with this rocket launcher here...

490
01:03:25,885 --> 01:03:27,887
and took out the sled.

491
01:03:27,970 --> 01:03:32,099
Guards took off on foot but rigged 
the door so no one could follow.

492
01:03:33,142 --> 01:03:37,730
<i>They'll take the one ship in the hangar 
and leave everyone else here to die.</i>

493
01:03:37,814 --> 01:03:41,192
How come you know all this shit?

494
01:03:41,275 --> 01:03:43,277
You weren't even here.

495
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,405
'Cause it was my plan.

496
01:03:52,161 --> 01:03:54,705
I shoulda taken the money.

497
01:04:00,586 --> 01:04:03,673
Riddick!

498
01:04:14,267 --> 01:04:17,395
<i>What is this? 
What is he thinking?</i>

499
01:04:17,478 --> 01:04:20,439
<i>- Once that sun comes up... 
- We'll last five minutes.</i>

500
01:04:20,481 --> 01:04:24,443
Five minutes. We ain't gonna last 
30 seconds out there.

501
01:04:24,527 --> 01:04:26,529
It'll light you up like a match.

502
01:04:31,117 --> 01:04:35,288
20-mile buffer zone 
and 30 klicks to the hangar.

503
01:04:37,456 --> 01:04:40,710
30 klicks over that terrain?

504
01:04:52,346 --> 01:04:57,393
It's moving in the right direction. 
We could make it.

505
01:04:57,768 --> 01:05:00,479
Stay behind the night,

506
01:05:00,521 --> 01:05:02,857
ahead of the sun.

507
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:05,234
There's gonna be one speed...

508
01:05:07,361 --> 01:05:09,322
mine.

509
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,784
<i>If you can't keep up, don't step up.</i>

510
01:05:13,868 --> 01:05:15,786
You'll just die.

511
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,686
<i>Riddick?</i>

512
01:06:23,771 --> 01:06:25,731
Riddick?

513
01:06:29,110 --> 01:06:31,112
Riddick?

514
01:06:35,616 --> 01:06:39,161
Go, go! Go on! Go! Climb here!

515
01:06:39,245 --> 01:06:41,914
Climb! Go! Go, go, go!

516
01:07:07,606 --> 01:07:09,442
Boss!

517
01:07:13,279 --> 01:07:15,239
<i>Up there.</i>

518
01:07:15,322 --> 01:07:17,491
- Take a look. 
- Because Anatoli says so?

519
01:07:17,575 --> 01:07:20,661
Because his nose says so.

520
01:07:37,970 --> 01:07:40,514
There's nothin' up here.

521
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:44,018
Oh, shit.

522
01:07:53,819 --> 01:07:56,363
Riddick.

523
01:07:56,447 --> 01:08:00,075
<i>They're heading right for the volcano 
fields. They're going for our ship!</i>

524
01:08:00,159 --> 01:08:02,745
No chance do they get to 
the hangar first. No chance!

525
01:08:14,548 --> 01:08:16,717
Next one! Next hole! 
We'll catch 'em there!

526
01:08:44,662 --> 01:08:46,956
<i>No more run for you.</i>

527
01:08:52,169 --> 01:08:55,589
Where did the big guy go?

528
01:09:01,345 --> 01:09:03,305
Ohh...

529
01:09:28,372 --> 01:09:30,124
Close it!

530
01:10:01,697 --> 01:10:04,533
What was that? 
You don't care if you live or die?

531
01:10:04,617 --> 01:10:07,620
If I kill them first, not really.

532
01:10:09,288 --> 01:10:11,373
Maybe I do.

533
01:10:11,457 --> 01:10:13,459
Keep moving!

534
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:13,852
<i>Kyra?</i>

535
01:11:13,936 --> 01:11:16,605
Get that ass moving!

536
01:11:57,479 --> 01:11:58,981
"One speed. "

537
01:12:19,585 --> 01:12:21,462
Temperature differential.

538
01:12:21,545 --> 01:12:24,006
Your rope.

539
01:12:23,172 --> 01:12:26,467
It's too late. 
We're never gonna make it.

540
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:28,635
Your rope! Gimme your rope!

541
01:12:29,762 --> 01:12:31,847
And your water. All of it!

542
01:12:32,890 --> 01:12:36,352
Stay in the shadow of the mountain. 
Don't wait for me. Run!

543
01:12:48,238 --> 01:12:50,616
Riddick!

544
01:13:01,668 --> 01:13:03,087
Aaah!

545
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:36,495
Where the hell is that hangar?

546
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:45,295
<i>There it is.</i>

547
01:13:47,297 --> 01:13:51,593
<i>Listen.</i>

548
01:14:16,910 --> 01:14:16,952
Let me guess. Necros.

549
01:14:44,897 --> 01:14:50,027
I figure we got three minutes before the sun 
hits us again, burns out this whole valley.

550
01:14:50,110 --> 01:14:52,821
- Wait. 
- We gonna do this or not?

551
01:14:52,905 --> 01:14:54,781
Just wait.

552
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,635
Aaah! Boss!

553
01:15:46,750 --> 01:15:48,460
On the right!

554
01:15:55,968 --> 01:15:57,761
Watch out! 
Behind you!

555
01:15:57,844 --> 01:15:59,596
<i>Kyra!</i>

556
01:16:55,652 --> 01:16:57,696
Sybar!

557
01:17:59,216 --> 01:18:01,176
<i>No!</i>

558
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:49,910
Kyra?

559
01:19:53,789 --> 01:19:56,708
<i>I was supposed to 
deliver a message to you...</i>

560
01:19:58,710 --> 01:20:01,004
if Vaako failed to kill you.

561
01:20:02,881 --> 01:20:05,675
A message from 
the Lord Marshal himself.

562
01:20:07,552 --> 01:20:11,056
He tells you to stay away from Helion, 
stay away from him,

563
01:20:12,390 --> 01:20:14,518
and in return, 
you'll be hunted no more.

564
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:24,361
But Vaako will most likely 
report you as dead.

565
01:20:25,737 --> 01:20:28,031
So this is your chance.

566
01:20:27,155 --> 01:20:31,868
Your chance to do 
what no man has ever done.

567
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:33,912
The girl.

568
01:20:34,955 --> 01:20:36,331
Where will they take her?

569
01:20:37,874 --> 01:20:41,378
We all began... as something else.

570
01:20:44,631 --> 01:20:47,342
I've done... unbelievable things...

571
01:20:44,756 --> 01:20:46,466
I've done... unbelievable things...

572
01:20:48,343 --> 01:20:50,220
in the name of a faith 
that was never my own.

573
01:20:53,014 --> 01:20:56,977
And he'll do to her 
what he did to me.

574
01:21:03,233 --> 01:21:07,862
The Necromonger in me 
warns you not to go back.

575
01:21:09,197 --> 01:21:11,825
But the Furyan in me...

576
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:17,122
hopes you won't listen.

577
01:22:24,189 --> 01:22:27,067
<i>I have lost a Purifier...</i>

578
01:22:28,318 --> 01:22:33,114
<i>but I have gained 
a first among commanders.</i>

579
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:36,743
It is overdue, isn't it...

580
01:22:36,826 --> 01:22:39,496
that we acknowledge 
your many accomplishments,

581
01:22:39,579 --> 01:22:40,830
<i>your steady faith,</i>

582
01:22:41,831 --> 01:22:47,337
and above all, 
your unflinching loyalty.

583
01:22:55,095 --> 01:22:58,598
Obedience without question. 
Loyalty till UnderVerse come.

584
01:23:01,101 --> 01:23:03,103
Well done, Vaako.

585
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:07,982
This is a day of days.

586
01:23:28,128 --> 01:23:30,672
<i>Now, tell me if it's true.</i>

587
01:23:30,714 --> 01:23:34,968
Tell me the Furyan is gone, and I can close 
this campaign without hearing his bootsteps.

588
01:23:35,552 --> 01:23:38,471
If he is dead,

589
01:23:39,639 --> 01:23:41,683
I sense I'm not far 
from the same fate,

590
01:23:42,726 --> 01:23:44,686
being of no further use here.

591
01:23:45,729 --> 01:23:48,815
Shouldn't I tell you 
that Riddick is still alive?

592
01:23:48,898 --> 01:23:50,692
Don't try me, Aereon.

593
01:23:50,734 --> 01:23:53,027
I could plough you under 
with the rest of Helion Prime.

594
01:23:53,069 --> 01:23:55,405
No one really knows the future.

595
01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:59,284
Then tell me the odds 
that Vaako met with success,

596
01:23:59,367 --> 01:24:01,369
that I will now be the one...

597
01:24:01,411 --> 01:24:04,330
who can carry his people across 
the threshold into UnderVerse,

598
01:24:04,414 --> 01:24:06,374
where they shall begin true life.

599
01:24:06,458 --> 01:24:08,752
Tell me what I want to hear, Aereon,

600
01:24:08,835 --> 01:24:12,922
and maybe 
I'll save your home world... for last.

601
01:24:17,761 --> 01:24:19,345
- The odds are good... 


602
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:24,058
That Riddick is still alive

603
01:25:02,430 --> 01:25:04,265
Ascension protocol!

604
01:25:04,307 --> 01:25:08,019
We still have numbers out there, Lord 
Marshal... sweep teams, recon ships.

605
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:10,146
They would be hard-pressed 
to make it back...

606
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:18,780
Get my armada off the ground!

607
01:26:38,359 --> 01:26:41,905
Final protocol. 
Execute on my order.

608
01:27:16,814 --> 01:27:18,107
Go inside.

609
01:28:10,493 --> 01:28:12,745
<i>We found this Lensor dead.</i>

610
01:28:15,331 --> 01:28:18,751
<i>Show me his last sight.</i>

611
01:28:31,180 --> 01:28:32,849
Commander Toal.

612
01:28:32,932 --> 01:28:34,934
He won't escape twice.

613
01:30:27,296 --> 01:30:30,424
Stay your weapons!

614
01:30:31,884 --> 01:30:33,886
He came for me.

615
01:31:00,663 --> 01:31:02,081
<i>Consider this:</i>

616
01:31:07,879 --> 01:31:11,966
<i>If you fall here now,</i>

617
01:31:12,049 --> 01:31:14,010
you'll never rise.

618
01:31:14,051 --> 01:31:17,180
<i>But if you choose another way...</i>

619
01:31:18,347 --> 01:31:20,516
<i>the Necromonger way...</i>

620
01:31:20,600 --> 01:31:23,144
<i>you'll die in due time...</i>

621
01:31:23,186 --> 01:31:26,939
and rise again in the UnderVerse.

622
01:31:36,574 --> 01:31:38,784
Go to him.

623
01:31:46,292 --> 01:31:48,294
It hurts...

624
01:31:49,295 --> 01:31:51,547
at first.

625
01:31:51,631 --> 01:31:55,218
But after a while, the pain 
goes away, just as they promise.

626
01:31:57,637 --> 01:32:00,181
- Are you with me, Kyra? 
- There's a moment...

627
01:32:00,223 --> 01:32:02,642
when you can almost 
see the UnderVerse through his eyes.

628
01:32:03,976 --> 01:32:06,729
It makes it sound perfect...

629
01:32:06,812 --> 01:32:08,731
a place where anyone 
can start over.

630
01:32:08,814 --> 01:32:11,275
Are you with me, Kyra?

631
01:32:23,829 --> 01:32:26,249
Convert now...

632
01:32:26,332 --> 01:32:28,501
or fall forever.

633
01:32:33,256 --> 01:32:35,549
You killed everything I know.

634
01:32:40,680 --> 01:32:41,889
Vaako.

635
01:32:43,975 --> 01:32:46,227
Not yet.

636
01:32:57,780 --> 01:33:00,783
Been a long time 
since I've seen my own blood.

637
01:34:19,028 --> 01:34:22,031
These are his last moments.

638
01:34:41,634 --> 01:34:44,470
Give me your soul.

639
01:34:49,517 --> 01:34:50,226
Never!

640
01:35:58,210 --> 01:36:00,463
You're not the one to bring me down.

641
01:36:37,041 --> 01:36:40,085
Help me, Vaako. Kill him.

642
01:36:47,718 --> 01:36:49,053
Vaako?

643
01:36:53,724 --> 01:36:55,559
Forgive me.

644
01:37:38,852 --> 01:37:41,438
I thought you were dead.

645
01:37:43,691 --> 01:37:46,277
Are you with me, Kyra?

646
01:37:48,320 --> 01:37:50,906
I was always with you.

647
01:37:53,242 --> 01:37:55,244
I was.

648
01:39:18,911 --> 01:39:20,746
You keep what you kill.
