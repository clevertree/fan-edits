The northern hemisphere

at the equator and is 
carried north by the ocean.

Good to have you back.

814
01:12:28,385 --> 01:12:30,471
What are you doing?

815
01:12:31,555 --> 01:12:33,682
The eye of the storm 
has passed,

816
01:12:33,766 --> 01:12:35,684
and we're 40 miles 
from Manhattan.

817
01:12:35,768 --> 01:12:37,853
Shouldn't we wait 
one more day?

818
01:12:40,522 --> 01:12:43,275
Sam may not have 
one more day.

819
01:13:54,429 --> 01:13:57,391
What do you think's 
gonna happen to us?

820
01:13:58,350 --> 01:14:00,436
What do you mean?

821
01:14:01,437 --> 01:14:03,772
I mean us. 
Civilization.

822
01:14:03,856 --> 01:14:05,816
Everybody.

823
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,946
Mankind survived 
the last ice age.

824
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,074
We're certainly capable 
of surviving this one.

825
01:14:15,909 --> 01:14:19,455
All depends on 
whether or not we're able 
to learn from our mistakes.

826
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:25,127
I sure as hell would like 
a chance to learn from mine.

827

You did everything you could.

828
01:14:31,675 --> 01:14:33,760
I was thinking about Sam.

829
01:14:39,683 --> 01:14:42,478
Jack, you know 
the chances of Sam--

830
01:14:54,239 --> 01:14:56,450
I made my son a promise.

831
01:14:58,035 --> 01:14:59,953
I'm going to keep it.

[ Man On Radio ] 
Parker, this is Houston. 
Do you read?

833
01:15:26,647 --> 01:15:28,649
Roger, Mission Control. 
Go ahead.

834
01:15:28,690 --> 01:15:32,569
We're getting scattered reports 
that the storm is dissipating 
over North America.

835
01:15:32,653 --> 01:15:35,030
Can you confirm?

836
01:15:36,281 --> 01:15:39,618
[ Parker ] 
Affirmative. 
It's finally clearing.

837
01:15:40,661 --> 01:15:42,621
We're over Europe right now.

838
01:15:42,704 --> 01:15:45,707
I can see landmass 
for the first time in days.

839
01:17:34,775 --> 01:17:37,277
How much further is it 
to the library?

840
01:17:37,319 --> 01:17:39,154
It should be...

841
01:17:42,699 --> 01:17:44,826
right here.

842
01:17:49,164 --> 01:17:51,291
I'm sorry, Jack.

843
01:18:28,453 --> 01:18:30,622
Sam?

844
01:19:38,523 --> 01:19:41,401
Who is that?

845
01:19:47,407 --> 01:19:49,826
My father.

846
01:19:53,163 --> 01:19:55,457
You made it.

847
01:19:59,669 --> 01:20:01,797
Of course I did.

Mr. President.

851

I just received 
a shortwave radio transmission 
from Jack Hall.

852
01:21:00,397 --> 01:21:02,816
He made it to New York.

853
01:21:02,857 --> 01:21:04,943
He says 
there are survivors.

854
01:21:06,611 --> 01:21:08,780
Thank you, Tom.

855
01:21:08,864 --> 01:21:10,991
That's--

856
01:21:11,866 --> 01:21:13,994
That's good news.

857
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:51,114
Jack! 
It's good to see you!

Have you ever seen the air 
so clear?
