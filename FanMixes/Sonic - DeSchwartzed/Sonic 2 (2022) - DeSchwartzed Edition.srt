1
00:01:43,978 --> 00:01:45,021
Doctor's log.

2
00:01:45,146 --> 00:01:48,525
It's day 243 in this...

3
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,152
portobello purgatory.

4
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:54,030
My only companion 
is a rock I named Stone.

5
00:01:56,783 --> 00:02:00,703
The question is, 
for whom am I narrating this?

6
00:02:02,705 --> 00:02:06,167
<i>It seems I've become a featured 
player in the theater of the absurd.</i>

7
00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:09,337
<i>Marooned in deep space 
by that wretched blue rodent.</i>

8
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:11,214
<i>But it's all good,</i>

9
00:02:11,339 --> 00:02:13,842
<i>thanks to a breathable atmosphere 
and my supreme intellect,</i>

10
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:17,303
<i>sharpened against the only 
competitor savvy enough to bring it.</i>

11
00:02:17,428 --> 00:02:19,764
Chanterelle to d4. Mmm.

12
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:23,184
<i>I've been striving to make fungi 
into a functional drink of choice...</i>

13
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:24,769
Mushroom coffee.

14
00:02:27,230 --> 00:02:29,232
<i>With limited...</i>

15
00:02:30,483 --> 00:02:31,568
<i>limited...</i>

16
00:02:33,236 --> 00:02:35,029
<i>limited...</i>

17
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:37,073
<i>success.</i>

18
00:02:40,201 --> 00:02:42,787
<i>But today, day 243,</i>

19
00:02:42,912 --> 00:02:46,249
<i>has brought a new optimism 
to my most pressing endeavor...</i>

20
00:02:46,374 --> 00:02:51,379
<i>Planetus exodus to returnicus 
and kick blue butticus.</i>

21
00:02:58,094 --> 00:02:59,762
If my calculations are correct,

22
00:02:59,888 --> 00:03:03,725
and there's no reason to say 
"if" because they always are...

23
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:08,104
this quill is going to power 
my masterpiece.

24
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:11,608
Let's light this candle...

25
00:03:12,984 --> 00:03:16,196
and see who comes 
a-knockin'.

26
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:23,137
Greetings!

27
00:04:28,851 --> 00:04:31,312
<i>Klaatu barada nikto.</i>

28
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:43,533
Agent Stone? Now!

29
00:04:52,583 --> 00:04:54,711
Thank you, Stone.

30
00:04:56,296 --> 00:05:01,426
It's time to say goodbye to 
this piece-of-shiitake planet!

31
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,603
Huh?

32
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,411
Where did you get that?

33
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,792
From a little blue menace 
on the planet called Earth.

34
00:05:37,253 --> 00:05:39,630
I'd be happy 
to show you the way.

35
00:05:48,347 --> 00:05:52,268
How excited are you, 
going to Hawaii with me? Oh, Hawaii.

36
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:54,437
Oh, yeah!

37
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,189
Wow.

38
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:59,192
Welcome to Sonic Air, 
the fastest way to travel.

39
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,694
Now boarding groups one and two.

40
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:04,280
Oh!

41
00:06:04,405 --> 00:06:06,282
Sonic, this is so fun!

42
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:06,407
There we go.

43
00:06:06,574 --> 00:06:08,576
Okay, you're free to go. 
Enjoy your trip.

44
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:10,036
Bye-bye now.

45
00:06:10,161 --> 00:06:11,704
Okay.

46
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,456
Okay, use this one 
to get back home.

47
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,208
Oh!

48
00:06:15,333 --> 00:06:16,709
All right, we're off.

49
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,960
Miss you already! Okay?

50
00:06:18,086 --> 00:06:19,962
Have fun at Rachel's wedding!

51
00:06:21,798 --> 00:06:23,091
Let's do this.

00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:16,394
I found him!

67
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:18,855
I just hope I'm not too late.

68
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:38,124
Hmm. He's close.

69
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:40,793
I just need a way to reach 
him without being spotted.

70
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:45,339

Perfect.

Oh, boy.

00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,484
<i>Aloha!</i>

77
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:07,653
<i>- How's it going, bud? 
- Oh, you know.</i>

78
00:08:07,778 --> 00:08:10,781
Just a quiet night at home, 
settling in with a good book.

79
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:12,033
<i>And you? What's up with you?</i>

80
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,826
I was just calling 
to say we're here.

81
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:14,494
Don't worry.

82
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:17,330
Everything here 
is completely normal.

83
00:08:17,496 --> 00:08:19,707
Uh-huh. Night, bud.

84
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,713
All right, Ozzy, 
it's movie night at Casa de Sonic,

85
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:27,048
and it's your turn to pick.

86
00:08:27,215 --> 00:08:29,425
<i>But I am not watching 
Snow Dogs again.</i>

87
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,846
Blackout!

88
00:08:33,971 --> 00:08:37,183
Ozzy!

89
00:08:37,308 --> 00:08:39,894
Oh, sorry, buddy. 
Everything's okay.

90
00:08:40,645 --> 00:08:42,063
Whoa!

91
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:50,488
Uh, excuse me. 
We did not order a poltergeist.

92
00:09:10,675 --> 00:09:11,842
Eggman?

93
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,516
Hello, hedgehog.

94
00:09:19,684 --> 00:09:21,185
Did you miss me?

95
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:23,854
I don't know how you got back,

96
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,649
but you made 
a big mistake coming here.

97
00:09:26,774 --> 00:09:29,986
<i>Au contraire, mon frère.</i>

98
00:09:30,111 --> 00:09:32,405
The mistake 
was thinking you'd won.

99
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:35,032
But that was just a prelude, 
an hors d'oeuvre,

100
00:09:35,199 --> 00:09:37,451
an aperitif, an amuse-bouche.

101
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,744
I get it.

102
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,831
I don't think you do.

103
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:43,666
But you're about to.

104
00:09:43,791 --> 00:09:46,669
And so will that idiot 
sheriff and his wife.

105
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:50,965
And your little dog too!

106
00:10:09,900 --> 00:10:10,943
Pitiful.

107
00:10:11,068 --> 00:10:14,030
What? Who are you?

108
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:18,159
Where are my manners?

109
00:10:18,701 --> 00:10:21,912
Sonic, meet Knuckles.

110
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,165
My new BFFAE.

111
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:27,543
Bestest friend forever and ever!

112
00:10:27,668 --> 00:10:30,921
Look, Robotnik, I don't care 
who you brought to help you.

113
00:10:31,047 --> 00:10:32,840
You're never going 
to get my power.

114
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:35,593
Do I look like 
I need your power?

115
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:49,607
So nice when diabolical evil 
lives up to the hype.

116
00:10:53,277 --> 00:10:54,445
Where is it?

117
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:57,782
Oh, you want it? Here it comes.

118
00:10:57,907 --> 00:11:01,077
I was expecting more of you.

119
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,620
You're unskilled.

120
00:11:03,454 --> 00:11:04,497
Untrained.

121
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,710
You forgot one. Unstoppable.

122
00:11:35,444 --> 00:11:39,073
It is my destiny to do 
what my ancestors could not...

123
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:43,744
To restore the ultimate power 
to the home of my people.

124
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,621
Ultimate power?

125
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:48,082
I don't know 
what you're talking about.

126
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:49,333
You've got the wrong guy.

127
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,544
Ultimate power?

128
00:11:51,669 --> 00:11:54,755
Now you speak-ee my language.

129
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,685
Come on. Get in! 
I'm on your side.

130
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,687
I'm sorry. Who are you?

131
00:12:11,021 --> 00:12:12,648
You know what? 
It doesn't matter.

132
00:12:15,151 --> 00:12:17,069
Get us out of here! 
Go, go, go!

133
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,202
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

134
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:26,871
Whoa!

135
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:33,586
What is going on? 
Robotnik's back?

136
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:36,005
And who is Clifford 
the Big Red Rage Monster?

137
00:12:36,172 --> 00:12:38,799
That's Knuckles, 
the last of the Echidnas

138
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:41,135
and the most dangerous warrior 
in the galaxy.

139
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:43,471
He's obsessed with finding 
the Master Emerald.

140
00:12:43,596 --> 00:12:45,806
Are you serious? 
The Master Emerald?

141
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:47,558
That's just a bedtime story.

142
00:12:47,683 --> 00:12:49,101
Well, he believes it's real.

143
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,771
And he must think 
you're the key to finding it.

144
00:12:53,689 --> 00:12:55,524
Red light! Give me the wheel!

145
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,735
Hey, what are you... 
Move your foot.

146
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,963
Just let me... Come on! 
What are you doing?

147
00:13:33,103 --> 00:13:34,063
We're flying.

148
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:50,037
Foxy move.

149
00:13:51,372 --> 00:13:53,249
You want something done right...

150
00:13:54,792 --> 00:13:57,878
You have to hire someone 
you can push around.

151
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:00,714
All caps.

152
00:14:10,849 --> 00:14:17,022
<i>♪ I waited till I saw the sun ♪</i>

153
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,066
<i>♪ I don't know why 
I didn't come ♪</i>

154
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:20,651
Doctor,

155
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:22,653
where are you?

156
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,578
Freak.

157
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:40,379
Oh, I, uh... I'm sorry, folks.

158
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,090
Uh, I have to close early. 
Everybody out!

159
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:46,427
Everybody out. Thank you 
for visiting the Mean Bean.

160
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,804
All right, good night. 
Good night.

161
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,991
He's back.

162
00:15:10,534 --> 00:15:13,120
He's back!

163
00:16:07,341 --> 00:16:09,760
That's more like it.

164
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:13,639
I've been re-hatched!

165
00:16:24,858 --> 00:16:29,405
So, my massively 
metacarpaled friend,

166
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:32,574
you mentioned...

167
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:34,660
Ultimate power.

168
00:16:34,785 --> 00:16:35,786
Back at the house?

169
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,496
The Master Emerald?

170
00:16:37,621 --> 00:16:39,164
It does not concern you.

171
00:16:39,289 --> 00:16:41,917
I got you off that planet and 
you brought me to the hedgehog.

172
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,044
We have no more use 
for each other.

173
00:16:44,211 --> 00:16:46,380
Well, I hate to be 
a contrarian, but...

174
00:16:47,589 --> 00:16:48,924
I think we might.

175
00:16:50,467 --> 00:16:52,386
You think these machines 
are a match for me?

176
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:54,638
Oh, they are stairs.

177
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:04,565
You see, Earth is my turf, G.

178
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,443
If you don't know how to floss, 
you'll be lost without me.

179
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,154
I understand nothing 
of what you just said.

180
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:15,033
I help you retrieve the Emerald, 
and you use it to...

181
00:17:16,034 --> 00:17:21,040
destroy the hedgehog!

182
00:17:21,206 --> 00:17:23,292
You're suggesting an alliance.

183
00:17:23,417 --> 00:17:27,755
Around here we simply 
grip each other's hands tightly.

184
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:31,383
Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow!

185
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:36,472
You truculent space bumpkin!

186
00:17:36,597 --> 00:17:38,891
You've crushed my favorite hand!

187
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:41,560
Really? My hand is uninjured.

188
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:42,728
Ugh.

189
00:17:42,853 --> 00:17:44,897
But I'm now convinced 
of your commitment.

190
00:17:45,063 --> 00:17:46,732
"Oh, goody,"

191
00:17:46,857 --> 00:17:50,569
he exclaimed, 
while he reset two of his knuckles.

192
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:52,905
I'm...

193
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:58,243
delighted to be 
on the same team.

194
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:07,503
Road trip!

195
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:10,464
I'll let you stick your 
nose out the window.

196
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:12,174
According to this map,

197
00:18:12,299 --> 00:18:13,801
the first clue is in Siberia.

198
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:16,303
It's a compass that 
will lead to the Emerald.

199
00:18:16,428 --> 00:18:19,389
And with Knuckles already here, 
it's a race.

200
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,433
We're gonna get there first.

201
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:29,274
<i>♪ Me and you 
Maybe sunshine, maybe rain ♪</i>

202
00:18:37,616 --> 00:18:40,119
Doctor. It's really you.

203
00:18:40,828 --> 00:18:42,830
You look different.

204
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:45,958
Papa's got a brand new 'stache.

205
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:47,876
Ha!

206
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,462
I knew it. I knew it!

207
00:18:50,587 --> 00:18:52,256
I knew you'd come back, sir.

208
00:18:52,381 --> 00:18:55,801
I never stopped steaming 
your Austrian goat's milk.

209
00:19:00,848 --> 00:19:02,349
Could use some mushroom.

210
00:19:04,017 --> 00:19:05,102
You brought something.

211
00:19:05,227 --> 00:19:09,064
Some kind of, uh, 
space porcupine.

212
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:12,150
Porcupine? I am an Echidna!

213
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:14,069
Welcome to the team.

214
00:19:20,325 --> 00:19:22,828
That means he trusts you, Stone.

215
00:19:22,953 --> 00:19:25,664
Now let's renovate this dump!

216
00:19:25,789 --> 00:19:28,959
Latte with steamed 
Austrian goat milk!

217
00:19:37,634 --> 00:19:42,139
"Just chilling. Watching TV."

218
00:19:42,306 --> 00:19:42,681
Dot, dot, dot.

219
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:45,058
Dot, dot, dot.

220
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,312
Dot, dot, dot.

221
00:19:48,478 --> 00:19:50,147
Doctor,

222
00:19:50,272 --> 00:19:53,650
why are we working 
with this imbecile?

223
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:59,281
Because that simpleminded space trash 
is the key to something extraordinary.

224
00:19:59,406 --> 00:20:02,326
Something to help you 
get revenge on the hedgehog.

225
00:20:02,451 --> 00:20:04,161
Think bigger, Stone.

226
00:20:04,286 --> 00:20:07,456
The emerald he seeks 
could power my wildest designs.

227
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:09,833
My genius wouldn't 
just be recognized on Earth.

228
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:12,878
It would spread virally 
to every corner of the galaxy,

229
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:17,132
allowing me to harness all the 
negative forces of the universe

230
00:20:17,257 --> 00:20:19,384
and commune 
with Darkness itself.

231
00:20:19,509 --> 00:20:22,221
Wow. That sounds big.

232
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:25,641
It's been on my vision board for 
years. It's the Law of Attraction.

233
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:28,560
<i>Didn't you see The Secret?</i>

234
00:20:28,685 --> 00:20:30,687
Kaplooey!

235
00:20:30,812 --> 00:20:31,605
Kaplooey.

236
00:20:31,730 --> 00:20:35,025
"Another boring night at home."

237
00:20:35,150 --> 00:20:37,069
The hedgehog has returned home!

238
00:20:37,194 --> 00:20:40,322
<i>Falsa. 
Which is Latin for "wrong-o."</i>

239
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:46,161
According to my worldwide network 
cell tower triangulation, he's lying,

240
00:20:46,286 --> 00:20:48,288
all the way

241
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:53,085
from the majestic hinterlands 
of Eastern Siberia.

242
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:56,630
He's a long-distance liar!

243
00:20:57,673 --> 00:21:00,759
Kuh! Kuh! Kuh! 
Nga-nga-nga-nga-nga!

244
00:21:00,884 --> 00:21:03,220
Yeah, there's more 
where that came from.

245
00:21:08,684 --> 00:21:11,979
I pinpointed the coordinates. 
It's right up ahead.

246
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:15,816
Wow.

247
00:21:25,867 --> 00:21:27,369
Hey, Tails. Wait up.

248
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:30,289
Whoa.

249
00:21:40,924 --> 00:21:42,259
Whoa.

250
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,678
Check this out.

251
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,138
Can you translate that?

252
00:21:46,304 --> 00:21:47,639
Uh, yeah.

253
00:21:48,807 --> 00:21:51,977
<i>Ages ago, 
a fearsome group of warriors,</i>

254
00:21:52,102 --> 00:21:53,770
<i>known as the Echidnas,</i>

255
00:21:53,895 --> 00:21:55,856
<i>forged the Seven Chaos Emeralds</i>

256
00:21:55,981 --> 00:22:00,235
<i>into the most unstoppable 
weapon ever created.</i>

257
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,865
The Master Emerald.

258
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:07,242
<i>With it, a single warrior</i>

259
00:22:07,367 --> 00:22:09,953
<i>could defeat entire armies.</i>

260
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:15,333
<i>Believing no one should 
have such power,</i>

261
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:18,337
<i>an order of heroes 
recovered the Emerald</i>

262
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,506
<i>and swore to protect it 
from evil.</i>

263
00:22:22,341 --> 00:22:24,134
Sounds like 
the Owls and the Echidnas

264
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,678
have been fighting 
each other for centuries.

265
00:22:31,224 --> 00:22:32,142
Whoa.

266
00:22:41,735 --> 00:22:44,905
Wait a second. 
I've seen these symbols before.

267
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,243
Here we go.

268
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,337
Well, that did something.

269
00:23:17,145 --> 00:23:18,814
Whoa! The compass!

270
00:23:18,939 --> 00:23:20,065
This will lead us 
to the Emerald!

271
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,949
Hey, you got 
a little something on your...

272
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:32,035
Oh, no. Tails, get back.

273
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:38,333
Run!

274
00:23:44,631 --> 00:23:45,674
That guy again?

275
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,843
Heads up, my little stalagmites.

276
00:23:47,968 --> 00:23:49,344
Someone call an Uber?

277
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:52,931
Hey, thanks for doing 
all the hard stuff.

278
00:23:55,350 --> 00:23:58,311
But we'll take it from here.

279
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:09,197
Oh! Whoo!

280
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:12,868
Good one! 
I'm sure that wasn't important.

281
00:24:15,203 --> 00:24:17,581
Tails, that's our exit. Come on.

282
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,345
Uh-huh. Let's split up.

283
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:33,555
Right.

284
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:36,057
Quick little stretch 
and here we go.

285
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:54,284
That's new.

286
00:24:54,409 --> 00:24:56,661
Whoa.

287
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:06,963
Sonic!

288
00:25:20,018 --> 00:25:20,769
Snowball fight!

289
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:38,787
Surrender the compass! 
You are no match for me.

290
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,836
My rings!

291
00:25:49,881 --> 00:25:53,677
Has anyone ever told you 
you've got serious anger issues?

292
00:25:53,843 --> 00:25:55,845
You mock me 
with your weak jokes,

293
00:25:56,012 --> 00:25:57,889
but you know nothing 
about me, hedgehog.

294
00:25:58,014 --> 00:26:02,310
Well, I know you Echidnas have a habit of 
showing up uninvited and ruining my life.

295
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:07,649
Sonic! Are you okay?

296
00:26:09,025 --> 00:26:12,112
Tails, take the compass 
and get out of here!

297
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,283
Yeah!

298
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:19,536
Later, haters!

299
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:24,082
Tails!

300
00:26:31,006 --> 00:26:32,382
Tails, come on. Wake up.

301
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:35,385
He chose helping the fox 
over pursuing the compass.

302
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,886
Of course he did.

303
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:39,598
New friend, 
same pathetic weakness.

304
00:26:39,723 --> 00:26:42,142
Hmm.

305
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:52,402
Oh, no. No, no, no. 
We're in real trouble here.

306
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:55,947
Come on, Tails. I need you to fly 
us out of here. Time to wake up.

307
00:27:03,246 --> 00:27:06,791
See ya, kids. 
Enjoy the fresh powder.

308
00:27:31,983 --> 00:27:33,276
Did you...

309
00:27:40,742 --> 00:27:42,994
What? This better 
be important. I just...

310
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,120
<i>Are you skiing?</i>

311
00:27:44,454 --> 00:27:46,414
I need you to use the ring I gave 
you to save me. Like right now.

312
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,793
<i>Okay, 
slow down. I don't even know where you are.</i>

313
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:52,253
You just gotta picture 
where you want the ring to go.

314
00:27:52,379 --> 00:27:53,713
So picture this.

315
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:58,968
Oh, my God. Okay, okay. Hang on.

316
00:28:06,726 --> 00:28:08,353
What?

317
00:28:09,854 --> 00:28:11,815
<i>Did you throw it?</i>

318
00:28:11,940 --> 00:28:14,275
<i>Oh, God. What? Tell me what "Oh, 
God."</i>

319
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:16,069
I mixed up the rings 
when I was teasing Jojo.

320
00:28:16,111 --> 00:28:17,862
<i>What? Where is it then?</i>

321
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:22,700
You don't want to know.

322
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:23,284
before I become 
a hedgehog-flavored snow cone.

323
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:25,412
Hang tight, buddy. I got this.

324
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:27,330
With this ring, Rachel...

325
00:28:27,455 --> 00:28:29,207
Hey! Hi.

326
00:28:29,332 --> 00:28:31,209
Uh... Everything okay, bud?

327
00:28:31,334 --> 00:28:33,002
Not really. What are you doing?

328
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,422
This is gonna sound crazy, 
but I need to see that ring

329
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,757
for just one second. 
Have you lost your mind?

330
00:28:37,882 --> 00:28:39,551
I'm gonna give it 
right back, I promise.

331
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:42,303
Please, Randall, it's really important. No, 
bro. Go sit down.

332
00:28:42,303 --> 00:28:42,679
With this ring... Yes, baby.

333
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,431
I'm so sorry about this.

334
00:28:54,649 --> 00:28:56,985
Snow, my God. Oh, boy.

335
00:28:57,569 --> 00:28:59,028
Incoming!

336
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:05,118
Oh.

337
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,041
Anybody hurt?

338
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:14,127
Sonic! Hawaii.

339
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:15,378
Are you okay?

340
00:29:15,503 --> 00:29:17,380
What's happening? 
Are you hurt?

341
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:19,215
No, no, I'm fine. Okay, good.

342
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:20,842
Because you're in 
so much trouble!

343
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,094
Okay, you calm down.

344
00:29:23,219 --> 00:29:24,429
You talk.

345
00:29:24,554 --> 00:29:26,055
Okay, quick version.

346
00:29:26,222 --> 00:29:28,475
Robotnik is back on Earth 
and he's after a magic emerald.

347
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:33,104
We need to get it back 
or the world is doomed.

348
00:29:33,646 --> 00:29:34,773
Tails!

349
00:29:34,898 --> 00:29:36,900
Wait! All this happened 
since yesterday?

350
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,318
Wait. Who's Tails?

351
00:29:38,443 --> 00:29:39,569
Tails, can you hear me?

352
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,613
Oh, Lord, 
there are two of them now.

353
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,032
Okay, let me think. 
Tails, come on, buddy.

354
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:50,038
Hey!

355
00:29:50,163 --> 00:29:52,624
Randall, 
why do all of your friends have weapons?

356
00:29:53,625 --> 00:29:56,836
It's okay, everyone. 
We're federal agents.

357
00:29:56,961 --> 00:29:59,881
You, too, Agent. Go ahead.

358
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,349
Aunt Maddie? Yeah.

359
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,434
Sonic and his friend 
dropped this.

360
00:30:18,107 --> 00:30:19,108
I have an idea.

361
00:30:22,654 --> 00:30:25,448
Hey, come on. 
You can't just leave us in here.

362
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:29,118
My friend is hurt! He needs a doctor, 
a vet, anyone!

363
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:31,663
Tails, 
you got to wake up, buddy.

364
00:30:31,788 --> 00:30:33,414
Please wake up.

365
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,674
All clear.

366
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:48,179
Shh! Shh!

367
00:31:02,068 --> 00:31:03,236
We got her.

368
00:31:03,361 --> 00:31:04,988
Move in.

369
00:31:08,575 --> 00:31:09,617
Okay.

370
00:31:25,842 --> 00:31:28,011
I did not mean to do that!

371
00:31:29,888 --> 00:31:31,973
Whoo!

372
00:31:34,726 --> 00:31:36,561
Maddie! Maddie!

373
00:31:36,686 --> 00:31:38,229
We're busting out of here. 
How'd you get past the guards?

374
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,190
Because that little fox 
is into some crazy stuff.

375
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:43,610
Come on.

376
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:45,695
Let's go. You're amazing.

377
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,465
Ah.

378
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,370
What's happening?

379
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:38,623
Wait for it.

380
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,470
Yes. Eureka!

381
00:32:53,596 --> 00:32:55,390
I've found it!

382
00:33:13,032 --> 00:33:14,367
Sonic.

383
00:33:16,119 --> 00:33:18,663
What is that? A big problem.

384
00:33:18,788 --> 00:33:20,623
The compass led Robotnik 
to the Emerald.

385
00:33:20,748 --> 00:33:23,000
That's got to be 
hundreds of miles away.

386
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,628
All right.

387
00:33:25,753 --> 00:33:27,797
Huddle up. 
Let's figure out a plan.

388
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:28,548
Together.

389
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,341
I'm not letting 
anyone else get hurt

390
00:33:30,466 --> 00:33:31,592
because of me.

391
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,511
I'm gonna fix this 
while I still can.

392
00:33:33,761 --> 00:33:36,305
Sonic!

393
00:33:36,472 --> 00:33:38,850
Sonic, wait!

394
00:33:40,643 --> 00:33:43,438
Hold on. Wait. Don't move.

395
00:33:43,563 --> 00:33:45,231
Take it easy, little guy. 
You're hurt.

396
00:33:45,356 --> 00:33:49,068
But we have to help him. You 
don't know what he's up against.

397
00:34:01,330 --> 00:34:03,124
Ugh. Water.

398
00:34:03,249 --> 00:34:05,376
Why did it have to be water?

399
00:34:08,087 --> 00:34:10,965
Okay, you can do this.

400
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,345
Gotta go fast.

401
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,436
Oh!

402
00:35:57,488 --> 00:36:02,118
I don't want to die 
like this! It's derivative!

403
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:05,496
Make room for Daddy!

404
00:36:13,254 --> 00:36:15,006
Two and two. Great!

405
00:36:14,213 --> 00:36:18,217
We're still bipedals, 
more or less.

406
00:36:21,095 --> 00:36:22,763
Fire in the hole!

407
00:36:24,473 --> 00:36:28,102
I've solved it. There is a 
booby trap every seven seco...

408
00:36:34,609 --> 00:36:36,569
That was a little early. Mmm.

409
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:40,907
Oh! So glad it didn't 
cut off my mustache.

410
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:44,118
Hey, Little Red Wrecking Ball.

411
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:46,454
I know you're dying 
to get your Emerald on,

412
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:51,000
but can we be a little bit more 
mindful of our surroundings?

413
00:36:51,125 --> 00:36:52,126
May I?

414
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:01,302
<i>In 30 feet, turn left.</i>

415
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:02,637
Work smarter, not harder.

416
00:37:24,659 --> 00:37:26,202
My pelvis.

417
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:34,835
Okay, Secret Temple, 
let's see what you've got.

418
00:37:41,008 --> 00:37:42,677
Whoa!

419
00:37:42,843 --> 00:37:44,679
No, no, no! No!

420
00:37:49,183 --> 00:37:50,226
No.

421
00:37:51,352 --> 00:37:53,312
Yes!

422
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:00,069
<i>You have 
arrived at your destination.</i>

423
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:03,114
Wow. That really 
opened up the space.

424
00:38:03,239 --> 00:38:06,075
I can't even picture it 
with an impenetrable wall now.

425
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,577
And the rubble 
is always a nice touch.

426
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:21,215
At last. The Master Emerald.

427
00:38:21,382 --> 00:38:22,508
Ultimate power.

428
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,219
Soon order will be restored.

429
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:28,764
All because of what 
we have done together.

430
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:31,600
Such a lovely sentiment, 
Knuckles.

431
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:34,645
I think I feel 
a single tear forming.

432
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:38,524
Sadly...

433
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,943
You're as useful to me now

434
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:44,864
as a backstage pass 
to Limp Bizkit.

435
00:38:44,989 --> 00:38:46,490
Whoa, 
whoa, whoa, whoa!

436
00:38:59,086 --> 00:39:00,087
Nailed it.

437
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:05,426
This guy is always trying 
to spoil a bad thing!

438
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:07,178
Ah! You guys are here, too?

439
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:07,636
Took the long way, huh?

440
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:10,765
Is everything a joke to you?

441
00:39:10,890 --> 00:39:13,601
Why must you constantly 
interfere with my destiny?

442
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:17,605
Because my destiny is to 
protect my friends and family.

443
00:39:17,730 --> 00:39:19,607
I think I just threw up 
in my mouth.

444
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:26,113
And if you want that emerald, 
you're gonna have to go through me.

445
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:32,953
Whoa!

446
00:39:48,094 --> 00:39:51,055
The Echidna's 
taking no prisoners today!

447
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:55,226
Sonic has heart, 
but will he lose the quill to live?

448
00:39:56,644 --> 00:40:00,815
I don't want to fight you, 
but you're not giving me much choice.

449
00:40:05,986 --> 00:40:10,199
Too easy. Let's do this.

450
00:40:15,663 --> 00:40:17,123
Huh?

451
00:40:46,485 --> 00:40:48,279
Hi there, beautiful.

452
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,824
You're the real deal, 
aren't you?

453
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:01,750
Say goodbye, hedgehog.

454
00:41:05,004 --> 00:41:07,631
Knuckles, stop. 
Robotnik's stealing the Emerald!

455
00:41:10,009 --> 00:41:11,510
Mine.

456
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:15,181
Wait! That wasn't the deal.

457
00:41:17,391 --> 00:41:21,187
Oh, you poor, naive creature.

458
00:41:21,312 --> 00:41:23,063
It's not your fault.

459
00:41:23,189 --> 00:41:26,442
A more advanced intellect would 
have seen this move coming a mile away.

460
00:41:26,567 --> 00:41:28,694
Or 1.6 kilometers.

461
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:31,572
But I trusted you! 
You were my friend!

462
00:41:38,621 --> 00:41:41,874
I'm sorry. 
That just hit me funny.

463
00:41:41,081 --> 00:41:44,543
Let this be 
my final lesson to you,

464
00:41:44,668 --> 00:41:47,296
you dim-witted 
celestial skin tag.

465
00:41:48,214 --> 00:41:49,298
Friends...

466
00:41:49,423 --> 00:41:53,344
are open, honest 
and vulnerable with each other.

467
00:41:53,511 --> 00:41:56,013
Which means X squared times 
the hypotenuse of Y squared,

468
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,517
divided by the absolute value 
of friendship, equals...

469
00:41:59,642 --> 00:42:00,643
dookie!

470
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:02,186
Oh, no.

471
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:15,115
Chaos is power!

472
00:42:33,509 --> 00:42:34,301
Let's get out of here!

473
00:42:42,393 --> 00:42:45,604
That sly little fox!

474
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:50,484
Come on, Knucklehead. 
We're not beat yet.

475
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,204
Doctor, you're here.

476
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:08,961
Yes, 
I'm here, and yet I'm...

477
00:43:10,337 --> 00:43:11,797
not all there.

478
00:43:11,964 --> 00:43:13,465
Sir, are you feeling okay?

479
00:43:13,632 --> 00:43:18,304
I'm more than okay.

480
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:21,473
I'm upgraded.

481
00:43:21,598 --> 00:43:24,560
Sinister 3.0.

482
00:43:24,685 --> 00:43:28,314
My game is next level.

483
00:43:30,357 --> 00:43:31,734
Hi.

484
00:43:34,153 --> 00:43:40,409
I can smell the electricity 
in your brain.

485
00:43:42,369 --> 00:43:44,830
You smell like a snack plate.

486
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:49,543
Yeah, no, that's fair. 
I had a couple today.

487
00:43:49,668 --> 00:43:51,462
Sit down.

488
00:43:57,760 --> 00:43:59,636
I didn't know.

489
00:43:59,803 --> 00:44:02,973
'Cause he was in the chair, 
so I didn't... Okay.

490
00:44:03,098 --> 00:44:05,267
Sir? We have a problem.

491
00:44:09,855 --> 00:44:13,901
- All teams in position! 
- Set up a perimeter!

492
00:44:14,026 --> 00:44:15,903
Move! Move! Move!

493
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,253
<i>Incorrectus, my trusty barnacle.</i>

494
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,091
After all these years,

495
00:44:37,591 --> 00:44:39,593
what I finally got...

496
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,763
is a solution.

497
00:44:53,023 --> 00:44:54,692
Commander. Status report.

498
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,486
Robotnik is in there with Stone 
and a hostage. Possibly local PD.

499
00:45:09,581 --> 00:45:11,291
Um...

500
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:14,044
Okay.

501
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,839
Rockin' that new 
spring collection, I see.

502
00:45:16,964 --> 00:45:21,510
Well, if it isn't 
the Pastry King.

503
00:45:21,677 --> 00:45:23,011
The Donut Lord.

504
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,055
A real genius would remember 
the name of the guy

505
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:26,723
who helped kick your butt 
off this planet.

506
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:28,809
And I'll do it again 
if you mess with Green Hills.

507
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:33,689
Congratulations on your 
oh-so-temporary sense of superiority.

508
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,191
You're finished, Robotnik! 
We've taken everything.

509
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,861
Your lab, your drones, 
your funding!

510
00:45:38,986 --> 00:45:42,531
Let's see how big of a man you 
are without your silly little robots.

511
00:45:44,116 --> 00:45:46,285
Would you like to see how...

512
00:45:47,619 --> 00:45:49,955
big a man I can be?

513
00:46:00,632 --> 00:46:04,011
Welcome to the new norm.

514
00:46:14,021 --> 00:46:15,564
My God!

515
00:46:18,901 --> 00:46:22,738
Doctor! Take me with you!

516
00:46:46,136 --> 00:46:48,847
He's taking everything apart.

517
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:51,475
He's building something.

518
00:46:59,274 --> 00:47:01,485
That can only be one thing.

519
00:47:01,610 --> 00:47:04,071
The fearsome power 
of the Emerald.

520
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,490
If that thing really 
turns thoughts into power,

521
00:47:06,615 --> 00:47:08,242
we are in big trouble.

522
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:09,827
Robotnik has a lot 
of bad thoughts.

523
00:47:36,812 --> 00:47:38,063
Whoa.

524
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:44,236
Sir, you're magnificent!

525
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,321
Thank you, sycophant.

526
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:48,115
Your admiration is inevitable.

527
00:47:58,292 --> 00:48:00,460
World Domination playlist.

528
00:48:13,807 --> 00:48:15,183
Fall back.

529
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:19,396
Fall back! Quick! Retreat!

530
00:48:24,109 --> 00:48:25,485
Sonic!

531
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,703
Like a blister, 
he keeps coming back!

532
00:48:34,828 --> 00:48:37,748
He's on the okay-to-kill list. Shoot 
the missiles. Make a decision.

533
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:40,834
I need a moment, sir. I'm 
trying to figure out how to do this.

534
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,003
Did you even glance at a manual?

535
00:48:43,128 --> 00:48:44,463
No! I'll do it.

536
00:48:45,505 --> 00:48:46,590
Pardon my lightning.

537
00:48:46,715 --> 00:48:49,051
You might want to 
ground yourself.

538
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:52,137
Whoa!

539
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:54,014
Hang on!

540
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:57,643
Whoa!

541
00:49:00,020 --> 00:49:02,439
Whoa!

542
00:49:05,108 --> 00:49:06,318
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

543
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:09,071
Oh, 
yeah! Whoo! Whoo-hoo-hoo! Close one.

544
00:49:09,196 --> 00:49:11,365
Sonic!

545
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:16,662
Robotnik!

546
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:18,789
Deceiver!

547
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:21,625
Die, mosquito.

548
00:49:33,053 --> 00:49:35,180
Ooh! I felt that.

549
00:49:47,651 --> 00:49:50,320
Oh! Whoa!

550
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:55,450
What just happened?

551
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:59,162
It's the Stache Masher. 
Right here in the manual.

552
00:50:01,164 --> 00:50:02,749
Return to sender.

553
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:12,342
Stone?

554
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:15,053
Oh, great.

555
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:18,348
Next thing you know, there'll be a 
report about a hostile work environment.

556
00:50:22,352 --> 00:50:24,187
Time to fight.

557
00:50:31,486 --> 00:50:32,821
We have to find his weak spot.

558
00:50:32,821 --> 00:50:34,531
Hedgehog!

559
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,158
Look out!

560
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,582
Let's go!

561
00:50:47,836 --> 00:50:48,879
All right, mustache.

562
00:50:49,796 --> 00:50:51,423
 Come and get me.

563
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:54,092
You don't tell me 
about coming and getting.

564
00:50:54,217 --> 00:50:56,887
I am on the cutting edge 
of coming and getting!

565
00:50:57,012 --> 00:50:58,680
Coming, getting.

566
00:50:58,805 --> 00:50:59,806
Coming, getting.

567
00:51:03,935 --> 00:51:07,439
Go! Move, guys! Move back! Let's go, 
that's it! Go, go, go!

568
00:51:07,564 --> 00:51:08,565
Keep going! Go! Go!

569
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:10,442
No, no! Stop! Stop the truck!

570
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,110
Tom, what happened here?

571
00:51:12,235 --> 00:51:14,780
You thinking what I'm 
thinking? Let's get our kid.

572
00:51:14,905 --> 00:51:16,448
We need your truck!

573
00:51:22,370 --> 00:51:25,624
Coming, 
getting. Whew!

574
00:51:25,749 --> 00:51:27,334
Yoo-hoo!

575
00:51:27,459 --> 00:51:29,169
So what's the 
plan here?

576
00:51:29,294 --> 00:51:30,128
Huh?

577
00:51:30,295 --> 00:51:32,005
You gonna build 
a big robot house?

578
00:51:32,130 --> 00:51:34,466
Get yourself a big robot wife?

579
00:51:34,591 --> 00:51:38,970
I'm going to enslave humanity and 
force them to service my machines.

580
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:41,932
First, Green Hills. 
Then the universe.

581
00:51:42,057 --> 00:51:43,308
Then the multiverse.

582
00:51:43,433 --> 00:51:46,311
Then who knows? 
Maybe that'll be enough.

583
00:51:46,436 --> 00:51:48,313
Full disclosure?

584
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:51,858
You won't be there.

585
00:52:08,542 --> 00:52:10,752
Snot rocket!

586
00:52:12,170 --> 00:52:13,255
No, no, no!

587
00:52:19,761 --> 00:52:22,764
Giving up already?

588
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:27,102
Not so tough when you're fighting 
someone 700 times your size, are ya?

589
00:52:28,979 --> 00:52:31,481
You can't beat me!

590
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:34,985
I'm all-powerful! All-knowing!

591
00:52:37,529 --> 00:52:39,948
All-seeing.

592
00:52:40,824 --> 00:52:42,993
Looks like your fancy robot 
has a glitch.

593
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,370
Is it me? 
What about me? I'm over here.

594
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:47,205
Up top! Down below! 
Behind you!

595
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,416
I'm 
over here. Sorry! Over here.

596
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,084
Too slow! Try again.

597
00:52:51,209 --> 00:52:53,378
You can't outsmart me. 
Missed me again.

598
00:52:53,503 --> 00:52:54,504
I'm the outsmarter-er!

599
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:58,133
Robotnik!

600
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,011
I am also a hologram.

601
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:03,013
Disloyal.

602
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:06,016
"Dis" is how I roll.

603
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:36,004
Where's my Emerald?

604
00:53:36,588 --> 00:53:38,381
No, no, no, no!

605
00:53:38,548 --> 00:53:41,051
Computer, auxiliary power.

606
00:53:43,261 --> 00:53:45,221
Move, you hunk of junk!

607
00:54:12,874 --> 00:54:13,917
Come on.

608
00:54:16,002 --> 00:54:18,380
There he is! Go! Go, go, go!

609
00:54:27,097 --> 00:54:28,098
No!

610
00:54:28,181 --> 00:54:29,641
We got you, Sonic.

611
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:32,352
Hold on!

612
00:54:45,323 --> 00:54:47,742
- You guys okay? 
- Yeah.

613
00:54:49,119 --> 00:54:50,829
Okay.

614
00:54:55,583 --> 00:54:57,544
I got the Emerald. 
We could still defeat him.

615
00:54:57,669 --> 00:55:00,964
Come on, come on. How does 
this thing work? What do I do?

616
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,925
What?

617
00:55:04,050 --> 00:55:06,845
No. No, no, no!

618
00:55:10,515 --> 00:55:14,894
Look at the happy little family.

619
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,452
No!

620
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:34,330
I got him!

621
00:55:34,456 --> 00:55:39,377
I finally got him!

622
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,550
What was that?

623
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,139
It's over, Eggman.

624
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:37,811
I like the 
new look. It works for you.

625
00:56:37,936 --> 00:56:39,938
What do you say 
we just let bygones be bygones?

626
00:56:41,022 --> 00:56:41,940
I did some things, 
you did some things.

627
00:56:42,982 --> 00:56:45,026
There are good people 
on both sides.

628
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,864
Surely two intelligent beings

629
00:56:51,449 --> 00:56:53,701
can work these things out!

630
00:57:04,546 --> 00:57:06,464
Come on, buddy.

631
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:07,966
Get him, Sonic! Come on.

632
00:57:08,091 --> 00:57:09,592
Yeah. Come on.

633
00:57:25,817 --> 00:57:27,610
It's like that?

634
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,448
Okay, we're not friends.

635
00:57:35,577 --> 00:57:38,037
Later, hater!

636
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,800
Sonic! Buddy!

637
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:09,861
Mmm.

638
00:58:10,028 --> 00:58:11,112
Oh, you got to try this.

639
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:13,781
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

640
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,875
Sonic! Whoa!

641
00:58:25,418 --> 00:58:27,337
Bring it in, bud.

642
00:58:28,463 --> 00:58:30,173
It's good to be back in blue.

643
00:58:37,472 --> 00:58:39,098
Whoa! You fixed it.

644
00:58:39,224 --> 00:58:42,602
I've spent my whole life 
questing for this.

645
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:43,937
Now I have it.

646
00:58:44,062 --> 00:58:45,813
Now we have it.

647
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:50,735
We must make a vow to use our 
powers to keep the universe safe,

648
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:51,819
Oh, I know!

649
00:58:51,986 --> 00:58:53,196
A power bump!

650
00:58:53,321 --> 00:58:54,989
Good idea.

651
00:58:55,156 --> 00:58:58,660
It's an Earth custom. 
An unbreakable promise.

652
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,662
Very well.

653
00:59:01,246 --> 00:59:03,831
A power bump it is.

654
00:59:04,916 --> 00:59:06,668
Power bump!

655
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:12,131
It's truly a beautiful day

656
00:59:12,257 --> 00:59:14,425
for baseball here 
in Green Hills.

657
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:16,261
An exciting lineup today

658
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:19,555
with the debut appearance 
of two new players!

659
00:59:19,681 --> 00:59:23,977
On the mound, 
rookie sensation from across the galaxy,

660
00:59:24,102 --> 00:59:26,479
Miles "Tails" Prower,

661
00:59:26,604 --> 00:59:31,776
facing off against the powerhouse, 
Knuckles the Echidna.

662
00:59:31,943 --> 00:59:33,194
Don't think about it too much.

663
00:59:33,319 --> 00:59:35,196
Just keep your elbow up, 
eye on the ball

664
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:36,531
and give it a ride.

665
00:59:40,785 --> 00:59:42,245
Power bump!

666
00:59:46,582 --> 00:59:48,751
Ha! Victory is mine!

667
00:59:48,876 --> 00:59:51,462
Hey, no fair! 
That shouldn't count.

668
00:59:51,587 --> 00:59:53,715
First base is also mine!

669
00:59:53,881 --> 00:59:55,550
I think that was our 
only ball.

670
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:57,677
I have conquered 
the second of the bases!

671
00:59:57,677 --> 00:59:59,971
Who wants ice cream?

672
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,389
Knocked the cover off that.

673
01:00:01,556 --> 01:00:03,850
Ice cream! Ice cream, yeah!

674
01:00:04,058 --> 01:00:06,394
I'm proud of our little guy.

675
01:00:06,519 --> 01:00:10,023
I really like his new friends, 
especially the red one.

676
01:00:10,148 --> 01:00:12,775
He cracks me up. 
Heck of a swing too.

677
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:14,068
Come on, fox.

678
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,820
Our dessert adventure 
awaits. Whoo!

679
01:00:15,945 --> 01:00:16,988
Good job, guys. Yeah.

680
01:00:17,113 --> 01:00:18,406
You too, baby.

681
01:00:18,573 --> 01:00:21,367
Let's go get some ice cream. 
Come on, come on.

682
01:00:21,492 --> 01:00:23,745
I'm happy for you, pal.

683
01:00:23,911 --> 01:00:25,288
Got your wingmen.

684
01:00:25,413 --> 01:00:26,748
Perfect friends to grow up with.

685
01:00:26,914 --> 01:00:30,585
Come on, 
Knuckles. Ah! My victory chariot!

686
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:34,797
Race you to the truck.

687
01:00:36,299 --> 01:00:37,550
One, two, three, go!

688
01:00:37,675 --> 01:00:40,136
No, don't go easy on me. 
I want your best.

689
01:00:40,261 --> 01:00:43,139
Sonic, I have just been told 
they have sprinkles.

690
01:00:43,306 --> 01:00:46,976
Ice cream and sprinkles? 
This is your new destiny.

691
01:00:47,101 --> 01:00:51,981
What a perfect meal to celebrate 
my victory over you in base of ball.

692
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,817
What? I mean, 
you barely beat me.

693
01:00:54,942 --> 01:00:58,154
Ha! You've never been 
beaten so hard.

694
01:02:32,915 --> 01:02:34,542
Agent, I want an update.

695
01:02:34,667 --> 01:02:37,754
Still searching, 
sir. We haven't found any sign of Robotnik.

696
01:02:37,879 --> 01:02:40,089
No one could've 
survived that crash.

697
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:43,426
He's toast. Good riddance.

698
01:02:43,551 --> 01:02:46,679
What a mess that lunatic made.

699
01:02:46,804 --> 01:02:49,432
Sir, there's something else.

700
01:02:49,599 --> 01:02:53,478
When we were wiping Robotnik off 
our database, we found something.

701
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:56,689
A file buried deep in our system 
and dating back over 50 years.

702
01:02:57,690 --> 01:02:59,233
What was it?

703
01:02:59,358 --> 01:02:59,650
Coordinates, sir.

704
01:03:00,693 --> 01:03:02,528
Coordinates? To what?

705
01:03:02,653 --> 01:03:05,740
<i>A secret research facility.</i>

706
01:03:05,865 --> 01:03:07,992
<i>It was a black site, sir.</i>

707
01:03:08,117 --> 01:03:10,953
<i>Someone worked very hard 
to keep this hidden.</i>

708
01:03:11,120 --> 01:03:13,414
<i>My God.</i>

709
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:15,833
<i>Project Shadow.</i>
