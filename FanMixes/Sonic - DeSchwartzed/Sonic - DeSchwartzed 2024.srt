1
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:13,073
Is that normal?

2
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:14,240
No.

3
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:18,912
- Someone's hacking the system. 
- What?

4
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:20,580
The containment tank 
is destabilizing.

5
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,415
He's waking up.

6
00:03:27,790 --> 00:03:29,250
2024?

7
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:32,795
I've been trapped for 50 years?

8
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:37,884
- Move, move! 
- Take positions!

9
00:03:41,346 --> 00:03:42,722
Get on the ground now!

10
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,683
We've got you surrounded!

11
00:03:55,234 --> 00:03:57,320
Okay, Captain, we got a 
rogue alien on the loose.

12
00:03:57,528 --> 00:03:59,030
How do we find 
him?

13
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:06,287
Finally, 
some action!

14
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:08,331
Okay, time to gear up.

15
00:04:08,498 --> 00:04:10,541
We're 
over the drop zone.

16
00:04:10,708 --> 00:04:13,211
All right, here 
we go. Showtime!

17
00:04:23,054 --> 00:04:25,098
What happened here?

18
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:27,183
Looks like GUN 
got their butts kicked.

19
00:04:38,152 --> 00:04:40,738
Whoa! Are you guys seeing this?

20
00:04:40,905 --> 00:04:43,449
- He looks just like you. 
- Impossible!

21
00:04:43,449 --> 00:04:46,035
Walk away, before you get hurt.

22
00:04:46,202 --> 00:04:47,829
Whoa, whoa, easy, buddy.

23
00:04:49,122 --> 00:04:50,873
We don't want to fight you.

24
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:53,751
Actually, Sonic, I 
would like to fight.

25
00:04:53,918 --> 00:04:55,336
Not now.

26
00:04:55,545 --> 00:04:57,422
Why don't you stop throwing 
cars at us for a second

27
00:04:57,463 --> 00:04:58,881
and come down here to talk?

28
00:04:59,048 --> 00:05:01,634
You jumped out of 
a GUN helicopter.

29
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,761
There's nothing to talk about.

30
00:05:03,928 --> 00:05:05,805
All right, then. Enough!

31
00:05:05,972 --> 00:05:07,181
Knuckles, no!

32
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,934
Let us talk with our fists!

33
00:05:24,782 --> 00:05:25,950
Knuckles!

34
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:28,286
Knuckles! Knuckles, 
are you okay?

35
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:29,704
No, not really. Ow!

36
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:33,791
Who is this guy?

37
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:35,126
He is much more impressive

38
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:37,128
than the hedgehog I 
fought previously.

39
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:39,213
Dude,
I'm standing right here

40
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:42,508
Now come on, he can't take us all at once

41
00:05:43,134 --> 00:05:44,927
Ow!

42
00:05:52,602 --> 00:05:53,603
Weakling.

43
00:05:57,482 --> 00:05:59,108
Don't try to follow me.

44
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,031
Sonic, I know that look.

45
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,033
Going after him is a bad idea.

46
00:06:26,677 --> 00:06:28,137
Coming through!

47
00:06:35,478 --> 00:06:36,813
Watch out!

48
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,943
Yah!

49
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:25,069
Sonic!

50
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:26,404
Are you okay?

51
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:29,240
Sorry, buddy. I'm still 
working on this teamwork thing.

52
00:07:29,407 --> 00:07:30,908
So now what?

53
00:07:31,075 --> 00:07:33,286
Well, I'm not jumping out 
of any more helicopters

54
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,455
until we get some 
answers from GUN.

55
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,206
We need somewhere to regroup.

56
00:07:38,708 --> 00:07:40,543
I know just the place.

57
00:07:50,344 --> 00:07:51,637
Commander Walters!

58
00:07:51,929 --> 00:07:52,972
Sonic.

59
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:56,809
Thank God you're all okay. 
I'm sure you have questions.

60
00:07:57,101 --> 00:07:58,519
Who was that guy?

61
00:07:58,686 --> 00:08:01,355
Shadow's story began a 
lot like yours, Sonic.

62
00:08:01,564 --> 00:08:04,317
But where you found family 
and friends on this planet,

63
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:08,029
Shadow found only pain and loss.

64
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,115
<i>It begins over 50 years ago,</i>

65
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:14,410
<i>with a meteor crash in a 
quiet corner of Oklahoma.</i>

66
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:18,206
<i>The meteorite 
contained a life-form.</i>

67
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:22,752
<i>The ultimate life-form.</i>

68
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,215
<i>Shadow's power... 
his "chaos energy"...</i>

69
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:30,384
<i>went far beyond any 
living creature.</i>

70
00:08:33,012 --> 00:08:35,598
<i>The scientist who discovered 
him believed this power</i>

71
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:37,934
<i>would usher in a new 
era for humanity.</i>

72
00:08:39,435 --> 00:08:42,605
<i>But Shadow's power 
proved too dangerous.</i>

73
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,526
<i>A terrible accident 
destroyed the lab,</i>

74
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,946
<i>taking human lives 
with it.</i>

75
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:54,367
<i>The project leader was blamed 
for the incident and imprisoned.</i>

76
00:08:54,575 --> 00:08:56,285
<i>With the program 
canceled...</i>

77
00:08:56,369 --> 00:08:59,330
<i>Shadow was a loose end no 
one knew how to deal with.</i>

78
00:09:00,623 --> 00:09:02,541
<i>Too dangerous to 
be walking free,</i>

79
00:09:02,708 --> 00:09:05,044
<i>too valuable to destroy.</i>

80
00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,214
<i>So I had him placed 
into stasis</i>

81
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:14,470
Wait a second. If Shadow's 
been on ice for 50 years,

82
00:09:14,637 --> 00:09:16,931
- someone had to help him escape. 
- True.

83
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:18,724
But there's only a few 
people in the world

84
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,768
who even know of 
Shadow's existence.

85
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:39,120
Get down!

86
00:09:54,719 --> 00:09:55,970
Egg drones?

87
00:09:56,137 --> 00:09:58,848
But Robotnik is 
supposed to be dead!

88
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:33,924
Commander Walters!

89
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,511
Commander 
Walters, are you okay?

90
00:10:38,721 --> 00:10:39,722
Sonic...

91
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,434
take this.

92
00:10:43,601 --> 00:10:45,645
What is 
it? A key...

93
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:49,440
to the most powerful 
weapon GUN has ever built.

94
00:10:49,607 --> 00:10:52,151
You're the only one I 
trust to keep it safe.

95
00:10:54,195 --> 00:10:55,488
Commander Walters...

96
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,831
Alpha team, fan out!

97
00:11:07,208 --> 00:11:08,584
Do we have eyes?

98
00:11:09,251 --> 00:11:10,252
Secure the perimeter!

99
00:11:13,547 --> 00:11:14,924
Medevac is en route.

100
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,221
His launch key is missing.

101
00:11:23,265 --> 00:11:24,725
Why are we 
running from GUN?

102
00:11:24,892 --> 00:11:26,394
Aren't we on the same team?

103
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,978
Until we get 
more information,

104
00:11:27,978 --> 00:11:29,689
we're not trusting anyone.

105
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:31,565
- Follow me. 
- Get it... off!

106
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:50,835
Who are you?

107
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,048
It's the Goat Milker!

108
00:11:56,715 --> 00:11:58,759
Relax. I'm not here to fight.

109
00:11:58,926 --> 00:12:01,971
- Then why are you here? 
- And why did you free Shadow?

110
00:12:01,262 --> 00:12:04,056
Are you kidding?

111
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:07,852
The last thing we want is more 
super-powered hedgehogs running around.

112
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:09,979
The doctor had 
nothing to do with it.

113
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,524
And I can prove 
it.

114
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:29,623
Please,

115
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:31,751
join me in the crab.

116
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,711
<i>Pablo!</i>

117
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,047
!¡Bastardo!

118
00:12:37,214 --> 00:12:39,592
Buenos días, !¡hermano!

119
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:40,926
<i>No!</i>

120
00:12:43,387 --> 00:12:45,681
Let that be a 
lesson to you, Juan.

121
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,433
Family

122
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:50,853
is a field of 
emotional claymores

123
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:53,230
that leave you 
abandoned, betrayed

124
00:12:55,024 --> 00:12:57,902
and weeping while you eat cake,

125
00:12:58,068 --> 00:13:00,446
which creates copious 
amounts of adipose tissue,

126
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:03,616
and what some calloused 
individuals refer to as...

127
00:13:03,782 --> 00:13:06,410
man boobs.

128
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:07,745
Ha.

129
00:13:25,554 --> 00:13:27,598
Doctor, we have visitors.

130
00:13:29,099 --> 00:13:31,101
Really?

131
00:13:31,268 --> 00:13:33,979
I thought I was having an 
anthropomorphic nightmare.

132
00:13:34,146 --> 00:13:35,773
Where the only person I 
could trust in the world

133
00:13:35,773 --> 00:13:37,316
showed up with all 
my worst enemies,

134
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:39,193
while I was in a bathrobe,

135
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,612
playing congas on 
my big, fat belly!

136
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,072
Sorry, sir.

137
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,366
I don't believe 
it. Eggman's alive?

138
00:13:45,533 --> 00:13:47,910
And he's never looked worse.

139
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:50,371
Well, maybe,

140
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:54,416
this is what not giving a damn what 
you think I look like looks like.

141
00:13:54,583 --> 00:13:57,795
Sir, right now we have 
an even bigger problem.

142
00:13:58,003 --> 00:13:59,380
Oh, come on.

143
00:14:01,507 --> 00:14:03,801
There's an imposter out 
there using your technology.

144
00:14:04,009 --> 00:14:07,304
Imposter. That's 
impossi... What?

145
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,973
No.

146
00:14:08,222 --> 00:14:13,185
My sweet mechanized spawn!

147
00:14:13,352 --> 00:14:16,981
Whomever this party-pooping 
posse is looking for

148
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:19,441
has stolen my persona

149
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,987
and the precious 
babies from my egg sac.

150
00:14:23,654 --> 00:14:25,155
Well...

151
00:14:25,322 --> 00:14:29,702
I'll soon egg-xact my revenge.

152
00:14:29,868 --> 00:14:31,537
You see what I did 
there?

153
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:34,957
It's time for the 
dramatic soap-opera twist,

154
00:14:35,124 --> 00:14:39,253
where this Pablo 
reveals his Juan!

155
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:43,299
By cross-referencing 
the precise coordinates

156
00:14:43,465 --> 00:14:46,218
of each drone's energy spikes,

157
00:14:46,969 --> 00:14:49,096
I can track my babies

158
00:14:49,263 --> 00:14:51,849
to the imposter's 
base of operations,

159
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:53,434
right about...

160
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:54,435
there!

161
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,229
All right, Egghead. 
I hate to say it,

162
00:14:57,396 --> 00:14:58,981
but it looks like 
we're partners.

163
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,026
On one condition.

164
00:15:03,485 --> 00:15:06,071
Dude, you have serious issues.

165
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:07,323
Ow!

166
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,328
Let's...

167
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,246
do this!

168
00:15:40,606 --> 00:15:41,857
Suck it in!

169
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,736
Tinker-tailor?

170
00:15:45,903 --> 00:15:47,321
I need room.

171
00:15:47,488 --> 00:15:50,157
Think Elvis, circa 1976.

172
00:15:50,324 --> 00:15:52,576
But sir, I don't have 
the proper materials.

173
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:54,995
Found some.

174
00:15:57,498 --> 00:15:58,707
Resourceful.

175
00:16:39,206 --> 00:16:40,374
Hey! This is a restricted area.

176
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,752
Oh, it's okay. She's the 
professor's granddaughter.

177
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:46,046
He takes her everywhere.

178
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:49,299
Welcome to the lab, Maria. 
I'm Captain Walters.

179
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,884
Oh, do you know 
where my room is?

180
00:16:51,051 --> 00:16:52,594
Yeah, down the hall 
and to the right.

181
00:16:52,803 --> 00:16:54,304
Make yourself at home.

182
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:55,639
But, um,

183
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,599
let's lose the 
skates, okay, kiddo?

184
00:16:57,808 --> 00:16:59,226
Okay.

185
00:19:19,449 --> 00:19:20,617
Look out!

186
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,775
Professor?

187
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:37,986
It's good to see you, Shadow.

188
00:20:38,153 --> 00:20:40,238
I knew you'd come home.

189
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,991
I can't get her out of my head.

190
00:20:43,158 --> 00:20:44,701
The pain...

191
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:46,203
It's too much.

192
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:49,873
And that is why we 
have to punish them.

193
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:01,176
This door is 
six-inch-thick solid steel

194
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,136
on a pressurized latch.

195
00:21:03,303 --> 00:21:05,472
I'll need a moment to 
calculate the molecular density

196
00:21:05,639 --> 00:21:07,265
and invert the 
venting mechanics.

197
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:12,187
I unlocked it.

198
00:21:12,354 --> 00:21:15,357
Subtle as 
always, fist-for-brains.

199
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,360
Easy, Shadow.

200
00:21:18,527 --> 00:21:21,029
Those are the guests 
I've been expecting.

201
00:21:21,196 --> 00:21:23,824
Let's give them a warm welcome.

202
00:21:27,661 --> 00:21:28,161
Whoa.

203
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,455
What is this place?

204
00:21:30,622 --> 00:21:32,582
It looks 
like a military base,

205
00:21:32,749 --> 00:21:34,584
but nobody's been 
here for years.

206
00:21:36,128 --> 00:21:38,380
Just a dark, creepy hallway.

207
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,215
Nothing to be afraid of.

208
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,677
You hear that, ghost?

209
00:21:43,844 --> 00:21:45,387
You don't frighten me!

210
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:52,227
Get... a... grip.

211
00:21:53,145 --> 00:21:54,896
Boo.

212
00:22:18,837 --> 00:22:22,382
Whoa. Look at all this stuff.

213
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:24,426
He had a family.

214
00:22:24,968 --> 00:22:27,012
Is that what I smell?

215
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:30,265
The stench of domestic harmony?

216
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:33,977
You ever wonder what your life would 
have been like if you had a family?

217
00:22:34,144 --> 00:22:35,562
Hmm... No!

218
00:22:35,771 --> 00:22:37,773
Maybe you wouldn't have 
gone full supervillain.

219
00:22:37,939 --> 00:22:40,776
I have no parents, 
no aunts, no uncles.

220
00:22:40,942 --> 00:22:43,445
And something about my 
attitude renders me...

221
00:22:44,404 --> 00:22:48,533
undesirable to all 
possible genders.

222
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:52,579
My future is a cul-de-sac!

223
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:55,582
The Robotnik name ends...

224
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,919
<i>avec moi.</i>

225
00:22:59,086 --> 00:23:01,129
Yes, I know French.

226
00:23:05,634 --> 00:23:06,760
Whoa.

227
00:23:06,927 --> 00:23:09,930
Is this where you 
grew up, Shadow?

228
00:23:10,097 --> 00:23:11,890
No wonder you're so mad.

229
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,935
What happened here?

230
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,067
Where'd you go, hedgehog?

231
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:24,111
I wasn't finished 
trauma dumping.

232
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:28,740
My darlings!

233
00:23:30,617 --> 00:23:33,036
My eggy weggies!

234

- don't believe it. 
- Don't you?

243
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,030
- It's impossible. 
- Is it?

244
00:24:09,197 --> 00:24:10,282
- It couldn't be. 
- Couldn't it?

245
00:24:10,323 --> 00:24:11,074
I'm... Are you?

246
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:12,450
Imposter!

247
00:24:12,617 --> 00:24:14,870
You stole my babies!

248
00:24:15,036 --> 00:24:18,206
But they know who 
their real daddy is...

249
00:24:18,415 --> 00:24:19,499
drone-napper!

250
00:24:21,376 --> 00:24:24,463
Magnificent creations, my boy.

251
00:24:24,629 --> 00:24:27,174
I borrowed them to lure you here

252
00:24:27,382 --> 00:24:29,384
and reunite our family.

253
00:24:31,094 --> 00:24:32,762
You see, Ivo...

254
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:37,893
I'm your grandfather:

255
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:40,520
Gerald Robotnik.

256
00:24:44,566 --> 00:24:47,235
My... grandfather?

257
00:24:48,987 --> 00:24:51,865
But how? And why?

258
00:24:52,657 --> 00:24:54,701
And who did what with whom?

259
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:59,789
You hail from an 
ancestry of excellence...

260
00:24:59,956 --> 00:25:01,625
tied directly <i>à moi.</i>

261
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,629
Yes, I know French.

262
00:25:08,131 --> 00:25:09,674
You do look like me.

263
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,594
But fatter. And older.

264
00:25:13,470 --> 00:25:15,430
And there's that funny smell.

265
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:19,935
But the resemblance is uncanny.

266
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,437
It's as if...

267
00:25:22,604 --> 00:25:24,689
we're two 
characters in a movie

268
00:25:24,856 --> 00:25:27,442
being played by the same actor.

269
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,028
- But I need real proof! 
- Ivo!

270
00:25:30,195 --> 00:25:31,530
We have very little time.

271
00:25:33,031 --> 00:25:35,158
But I could field a 
couple of queries.

272
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:38,495
Name the most elegant 
formula in mathematics.

273
00:25:38,662 --> 00:25:39,079
Euler's Identity.

274
00:25:40,163 --> 00:25:42,499
E to the I times pi 
plus one equals zilch.

275
00:25:42,666 --> 00:25:44,501
European capitals 
arranged alphabetically

276
00:25:44,668 --> 00:25:45,919
by the fourth letter.

277
00:25:46,086 --> 00:25:47,837
Riga, Monaco, Sarajevo, Tirana.

278
00:25:48,004 --> 00:25:49,881
The speed of light divided 
by the speed of sound,

279
00:25:49,965 --> 00:25:52,008
divided by the speed of 
the bus in the movie <i>Speed.</i>

280
00:25:53,718 --> 00:25:56,263
17,893.33333...

281
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,891
Rounding up? 17,894 MPH.

282
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,561
And, for all the marbles...

283
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:04,896
Good. I lost mine.

284
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:07,107
A rare lung disease,

285
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,402
and the longest word in 
the English dictionary.

286
00:26:11,027 --> 00:26:12,529
Um...

287
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:15,991
Pneumonoultramicroscopic- 
silicovolcanoconiosis!

288
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:20,537
- Pap-pap! 
- In the saggy flesh.

289
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:22,789
But looking pretty good 
for a hundred and ten.

290
00:26:25,208 --> 00:26:27,836
Oh, Grampy-poo!

291
00:26:31,214 --> 00:26:35,010
Where have you been 
my entire life?

292
00:26:36,928 --> 00:26:38,930
Wait.

293
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,308
Where have you been... 
my entire life?

294
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:47,480
Locked in a top-secret 
prison for the last 50 years.

295
00:26:47,689 --> 00:26:50,942
Made it kind of hard to 
send Christmas cards.

296
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,610
Now...

297
00:26:52,777 --> 00:26:56,323
you're probably wondering 
why I brought you here.

298
00:26:56,531 --> 00:26:57,907
You didn't bring me here!

299
00:26:58,074 --> 00:27:01,369
I used my unparalleled 
intellect to track you down.

300
00:27:01,578 --> 00:27:05,498
Per the plan I concocted with 
my unparalleled intellect.

301
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:07,459
You'll see.

302
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:10,170
I have the answer to everything.

303
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,465
Come on, kiddo.

304
00:27:27,228 --> 00:27:29,189
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.

305
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:31,191
Someone tell me 
this is some kind of

306
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,526
concussion-induced nightmare.

307
00:27:33,651 --> 00:27:35,653
Double your villains, 
double your fun!

308
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,615
Two Robotniks are 
way worse than one.

309
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:39,783
Chest bump?

310
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:40,950
No.

311
00:27:41,868 --> 00:27:43,953
Stone, why are you tied up?

312
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,706
Do that on your own 
time. You sicken me.

313
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:49,292
You must be the 
long-lost grandson.

314
00:27:49,459 --> 00:27:51,419
And you must be another 
stinking hedgehog.

315
00:27:52,504 --> 00:27:54,547
So you're the one 
behind all this.

316
00:27:54,714 --> 00:27:56,925
- The Shadow breakout. 
- The attack on Walters.

317
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,301
That musty old-man smell.

318
00:27:58,468 --> 00:28:00,428
How dare you insult me

319
00:28:00,595 --> 00:28:02,263
with your unsolicited 
exposition!

320
00:28:02,430 --> 00:28:04,516
Shadow, get the key.

321
00:28:04,974 --> 00:28:06,393
Yep, we're that stupid.

322
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,770
GUN took everything from us.

323
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:11,856
And now we are going to 
take everything from them.

324
00:28:12,023 --> 00:28:13,274
With this.

325
00:28:13,441 --> 00:28:17,112
My masterpiece of malevolence...

326
00:28:17,278 --> 00:28:19,823
The Eclipse Cannon.

327
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:23,076
<i>In exchange for my freedom,</i>

328
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:25,370
<i>I gave GUN the most 
powerful weapon</i>

329
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:28,081
<i>mankind has ever seen,</i>

330
00:28:28,248 --> 00:28:30,834
<i>capable of delivering 
a precision strike</i>

331
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,377
<i>anywhere on Earth.</i>

332
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:35,046
<i>Our first target:</i>

333
00:28:35,880 --> 00:28:37,507
<i>GUN Headquarters.</i>

334
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,843
But firing a weapon 
that powerful

335
00:28:40,009 --> 00:28:41,970
could threaten millions 
of innocent lives!

336
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,389
Yeah, tera-bite me.

337
00:28:44,597 --> 00:28:49,436
This is one of two keys required 
to launch the Eclipse Cannon.

338
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:51,938
The other is locked 
inside GUN headquarters.

339
00:28:52,105 --> 00:28:53,982
Once we have both,

340
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:56,985
I will take rightful 
control of my weapon.

341
00:28:57,152 --> 00:28:58,945
I'm in.

342
00:29:05,910 --> 00:29:07,370
Holy crab!

343
00:29:07,537 --> 00:29:09,164
Spacious 
and crustaceous.

344
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:11,249
Thank you so much

345
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,084
for inspiring this 
little adventure.

346
00:29:13,251 --> 00:29:15,420
It really worked out for me.

347
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,715
Shadow, wait! Don't do this.

348
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:23,261
I've spent 50 years reliving 
what they did to her.

349
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,882
Yeah! Yes!

350
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,595
Yikes.

351
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:13,186
I've spent years trying 
to cleanse the cosmos

352
00:30:13,353 --> 00:30:17,023
of that spiny, blue speed freak.

353
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,816
And you did it...

354
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:22,195
in one afternoon.

355
00:30:22,362 --> 00:30:26,282
There's nothing we can't 
destroy together, my boy.

356
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,327
Charting route to GUN 
Headquarters in London, sirs.

357
00:30:29,494 --> 00:30:31,579
ETA four hours.

358
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,081
As the crab flies.

359
00:30:33,248 --> 00:30:35,583
By all accounts, we're 
ahead of schedule.

360
00:30:36,543 --> 00:30:38,461
We should take this time

361
00:30:38,628 --> 00:30:40,630
to get to know 
each other better.

362
00:30:40,797 --> 00:30:42,549
Wow. What?

363
00:30:43,299 --> 00:30:44,384
You mean...

364
00:30:44,551 --> 00:30:47,804
spend some qua-qua-quality time?

365
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:52,725
You've waited for 
this your whole life.

366
00:30:52,892 --> 00:30:58,898
How would you choose to spend one 
perfect day with your new grand pal?

367
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:56,414
Ooh!

368
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:43,044
London, baby!

369
00:32:46,339 --> 00:32:48,841
GUN Headquarters is right there.

370
00:32:49,008 --> 00:32:52,970
Let me go in, get the key 
and destroy anyone in my way!

371
00:32:53,137 --> 00:32:54,722
I want revenge.

372
00:32:53,971 --> 00:32:56,265
Patience, Shadow.

373
00:32:56,432 --> 00:32:58,685
Just let us handle this...

374
00:32:59,686 --> 00:33:02,980
and I promise 
you'll have revenge

375
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:06,901
on a scale you couldn't 
possibly imagine.

376
00:33:07,068 --> 00:33:10,071
Come on, Granddaddy-O, 
we've got...

377
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,322
dirt to do!

378
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,282
Suits.

379
00:33:13,449 --> 00:33:14,450
Right here, sir.

380
00:33:15,493 --> 00:33:17,370
Stone, babysit the hedgehog.

381
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,956
Keep the crab on a low boil.

382
00:33:21,124 --> 00:33:23,459
It's time for more 
family bonding.

383
00:33:26,629 --> 00:33:28,881
Tom, Maddie, are you 
in position and ready?

384
00:33:29,048 --> 00:33:31,175
- We were born ready. 
- Let's do this.

385
00:33:31,342 --> 00:33:32,593
<i>Knuckles, 
how about you?</i>

386
00:33:32,719 --> 00:33:34,887
I have taken my perch 
atop the giant clock.

387
00:33:35,054 --> 00:33:36,889
All right, everyone 
knows what to do.

388
00:33:37,056 --> 00:33:39,142
Tom and Maddie, you guys 
plant the USB drive.

389
00:33:39,308 --> 00:33:41,853
I'll disable the traps. Sonic 
will snag the launch key.

390
00:33:42,019 --> 00:33:43,771
And Knuckles, you stand by to...

391
00:33:43,938 --> 00:33:46,274
Break glass in 
case of emergency.

392
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:47,483
Then we're all set.

393
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,359
Hologram time.

394
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:51,779
You go first.

395
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:04,834
Okay, Tails, what 
are we looking for?

396
00:34:05,043 --> 00:34:08,379
<i>The security server is in 
the 7th row, 23rd cabinet.</i>

397
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:11,424
All right, hang tight, guys. 
Maddie's about to insert the drive.

398
00:34:11,507 --> 00:34:12,508
Ready?

399
00:34:12,675 --> 00:34:13,843
<i>Three...</i>

400
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:15,178
<i>two...</i>

401
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:16,596
<i>one...</i>

402
00:34:18,181 --> 00:34:19,432
Go.

403
00:34:21,267 --> 00:34:23,060
I'm shutting down the 
outside sensors now.

404
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,604
Yes! Uh...

405
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,065
Hold on. Is...

406
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,983
there supposed to be 
another USB drive here?

407
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:31,569
One with a 
giant mustache on it?

408
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,989
Oh, no. I've got two heat 
signatures en route to the vault.

409
00:34:35,156 --> 00:34:36,532
Which can only mean...

410
00:34:42,955 --> 00:34:46,125
The Robotniks have 
entered the chat.

411
00:34:46,209 --> 00:34:48,085
Hello! What's this?

412
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:50,838
I knew I saw an outside signal!

413
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:52,882
<i>Cheerio!</i>

414
00:34:53,049 --> 00:34:55,009
<i>I guess someone forgot to flush.</i>

415
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:18,866
What now, my cunning cohort?

416
00:35:19,033 --> 00:35:20,535
Just a little teamwork!

417
00:35:28,459 --> 00:35:29,627
Hey...

418
00:35:30,294 --> 00:35:31,671
The lasers...

419
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,465
don't seem to be 
penetrating my suit.

420
00:35:36,759 --> 00:35:39,804
They're conforming to the 
shape of my bodacious bod.

421
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,389
Of course.

422
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:45,226
I designed these suits 
to create a field

423
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,478
of laser-bending 
thermal distortion.

424
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:49,564
Wasn't sure it 
would work till now.

425
00:35:49,772 --> 00:35:51,190
You're heartless, son.

426
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:53,234
- Hmm! 
- Rotten to the core.

427
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:55,111
- Mm-hmm. 
- I'm...

428
00:35:55,278 --> 00:35:56,487
so proud.

429
00:35:56,654 --> 00:35:59,031
So now we can just 
dance right through.

430
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,703
That sounds like a challenge.

431
00:36:48,748 --> 00:36:50,708
The Robotniks are 
almost at the vault!

432
00:36:50,875 --> 00:36:52,960
We're out of time. I'm going.

433
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:54,295
No, Sonic!

434
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,755
I haven't disabled 
the traps yet!

435
00:37:01,886 --> 00:37:03,221
You're not gonna make it!

436
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:04,430
I can make it.

437
00:37:07,934 --> 00:37:09,352
You're not gonna make it!

438
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:10,686
I'm gonna make it.

439
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,533
Our destiny awaits.

440
00:37:25,618 --> 00:37:27,453
Stop right there, Roboscum!

441
00:37:27,620 --> 00:37:29,830
- Let's do this! 
- Copy!

442
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,714
Too slow, Eggmen.

443
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,217
Now if you don't mind, 
I've got to get that key.

444
00:37:42,301 --> 00:37:43,511
Whoa!

445
00:37:43,511 --> 00:37:46,597
this vault is armed 
with variable gravity.

446
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:48,975
No kidding.

447
00:37:49,141 --> 00:37:50,935
Green goes up...

448
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,270
and red takes you down... hard.

449
00:37:53,479 --> 00:37:54,647
Rockwell, listen to me.

450
00:37:54,814 --> 00:37:56,607
The Robotniks are 
planning to...

451
00:37:56,774 --> 00:37:58,818
Oh, they're planning on stealing 
a second key, just like you are?

452
00:37:58,859 --> 00:38:00,236
Yes, I'm aware.

453
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:04,281
I called it the second 
Commander Walters was attacked.

454
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,950
So...

455
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:08,703
thank you for taking the bait

456
00:38:08,869 --> 00:38:10,371
and falling right into my trap.

457
00:38:10,538 --> 00:38:12,665
I don't believe this.

458
00:38:12,832 --> 00:38:14,458
I know, grandson.

459
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:16,627
A woman in the military!

460
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,964
Let's go.

461
00:38:21,048 --> 00:38:22,258
Go, positions!

462
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:23,551
Full perimeter.

463
00:38:25,094 --> 00:38:26,429
Robotnik.

464
00:38:26,595 --> 00:38:28,848
Going full spandex, 
huh? Who's the fossil?

465
00:38:29,015 --> 00:38:33,144
That's my grandfather, you 
dough-eating dimbecile.

466
00:38:33,310 --> 00:38:36,439
- Who are they? 
- A couple of bleeding hearts,

467
00:38:36,605 --> 00:38:39,442
here to rescue their 
emotional-support animals.

468
00:38:39,608 --> 00:38:41,402
Enough! It's over.

469
00:38:41,569 --> 00:38:45,114
The only way you're leaving 
here is in handcuffs.

470
00:38:45,281 --> 00:38:46,991
There is no other way out.

471
00:38:47,283 --> 00:38:49,201
Hey, big guy, 
I think it's time to...

472
00:38:50,369 --> 00:38:53,664
Break glass in 
case of emergency!

473
00:39:00,796 --> 00:39:03,841
Ha! Nothing can 
stop Team Knuckles!

474
00:39:04,050 --> 00:39:05,134
Open fire!

475
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:08,012
Knuckles, 
turn this stuff off!

476
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,472
- Hurry! 
- On it.

477
00:39:11,098 --> 00:39:12,183
Uh-oh.

478
00:39:27,114 --> 00:39:29,158
- Can you move? 
- No, not at all.

479
00:39:29,325 --> 00:39:31,786
- Tails, can you? 
- No, I'm stuck.

480
00:39:31,952 --> 00:39:33,329
We might be here a while.

481
00:39:35,706 --> 00:39:37,958
Whoa! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

482
00:39:38,959 --> 00:39:40,377
Where's the key?

483
00:39:45,383 --> 00:39:47,551
Whoa!

484
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,428
- What was that? 
- We might have a problem.

485
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:53,974
No, no, no, no!

486
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,789
I'm moving.

487
00:40:17,581 --> 00:40:19,166
I'm moving!

488
00:40:22,336 --> 00:40:24,797
You go get it, grandson!

489
00:40:24,880 --> 00:40:26,715
Oh, whoa, whoa...

490
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:31,095
No. No, no!

491
00:40:31,720 --> 00:40:33,389
I'm almost there!

492
00:40:36,225 --> 00:40:37,017
Whoa!

493
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,203
That was so not worth it!

494
00:40:58,622 --> 00:41:00,374
- You okay? 
- Yeah. You good?

495
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,292
Sonic!

496
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:03,294
Hey.

497
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,462
Thanks for the save.

498
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,298
Cutting it a little 
close, don't you think?

499
00:41:08,591 --> 00:41:09,925
Secure the room!

500
00:41:11,927 --> 00:41:13,179
She's got the key.

501
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:16,974
I got an idea.

502
00:41:26,233 --> 00:41:27,651
Commander Walters.

503
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:28,903
Sir.

504
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,696
You're... Still alive?

505
00:41:30,863 --> 00:41:33,657
I'll die before I let that 
key fall into the wrong hands.

506
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:35,910
Thanks for keeping it safe.

507
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:37,578
I'll take it from here.

508
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,124
That's an order, 
Director Rockwell.

509
00:41:45,794 --> 00:41:48,464
Now, organize the 
reinforcements.

510
00:41:49,798 --> 00:41:50,883
Yes, sir.

511
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:58,849
Guys, guys, I got the key. 
I repeat, I got the key.

512
00:41:59,016 --> 00:42:00,643
Now let's get out of here.

513
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:07,149
Commander Walters.

514
00:42:07,316 --> 00:42:08,984
No, no. No. Wait!

515
00:42:23,290 --> 00:42:24,708
What?

516
00:42:24,875 --> 00:42:27,419
Tom! Everyone's clear! 
Come on, let's go!

517
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,463
You. What are you...

518
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:32,216
Tom!

519
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,386
Tom. Tom, what happened?

520
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:38,639
Please, please, please get up. 
Hey, come on, please wake up.

521
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,849
Wake up, wake up, wake up!

522
00:42:41,558 --> 00:42:42,977
Maria.

523
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:48,732
What did you do?

524
00:42:50,943 --> 00:42:52,987
What I had to.

525
00:42:55,656 --> 00:42:57,324
Oh, my God. Tom!

526
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,246
Help me up, kid.

527
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:06,375
Freeze! Don't move!

528
00:43:06,584 --> 00:43:11,422
Any tricks up your sleeve, 
Captain Grandtastic?

529
00:43:18,178 --> 00:43:20,222
We got what we came for.

530
00:43:20,973 --> 00:43:23,851
Great job, Shadow.

531
00:43:24,602 --> 00:43:27,438
We have both keys.

532
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,399
So where's your little 
science project?

533
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,779
It's closer than 
you think, my boy.

534
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:39,450
Welcome...

535
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:42,995
to my masterpiece!

536
00:43:45,914 --> 00:43:47,666
I must hand it to GUN.

537
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:50,336
They built her to my 
exact specifications.

538
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,629
It's...

539
00:43:54,256 --> 00:43:55,841
remarkable!

540
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:57,217
Mm-hmm.

541
00:43:57,384 --> 00:44:00,220
- Astounding! 
- Yes.

542
00:44:01,347 --> 00:44:03,474
That's my genius grand-genome!

543
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:07,269
And I have one more surprise.

544
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:13,776
It's a new suit!

545
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:46,475
<i>♪ I'm a chip off 
The old block! ♪</i>

546
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,062
What do you want, 
Stone? I'm busy.

547
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:53,232
Doctor, I have a bad 
feeling about this.

548
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:56,360
I don't think your grandfather's 
been completely honest with us.

549
00:44:57,277 --> 00:44:58,487
<i>There's more to their plan.</i>

550
00:44:59,905 --> 00:45:02,950
How dare you!

551
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,911
You have been jealous of 
my long-lost grand-Pop-Tart

552
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:08,247
since the very beginning!

553
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:11,083
I no longer require your 
obsequious groveling.

554
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:13,711
<i>Consider this your 
notice of termination.</i>

555
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:17,297
Your letter of reference 
will be L for Loser.

556
00:45:17,464 --> 00:45:19,299
Of course, I'll 
expect you to stay on

557
00:45:19,466 --> 00:45:20,926
until you've been 
successfully cloned.

558
00:45:21,135 --> 00:45:24,596
But you and I are done!

559
00:45:24,763 --> 00:45:27,224
Like a blackened catfish dinner!

560
00:45:27,391 --> 00:45:30,644
Sir, it's too dangerous and 
I'm not there to protect you.

561
00:45:30,811 --> 00:45:31,979
I already lost you once! I...

562
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,273
Unsubscribe. Blocked 
and reported.

563
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,401
I 
can't lose you again.

564
00:45:43,824 --> 00:45:45,409
Do the honors...

565
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,327
grandson.

566
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,539
Here we go.

567
00:47:33,725 --> 00:47:34,726
Sonic!

568
00:47:40,607 --> 00:47:43,652
<i>This is an urgent 
national emergency broadcast.</i>

569
00:47:43,819 --> 00:47:46,280
<i>A spacecraft designed 
by the agency GUN</i>

570
00:47:46,446 --> 00:47:49,366
<i>has been hijacked and launched 
out of the River Thames.</i>

571
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:58,208
<i>All residents are urged 
to seek immediate shelter.</i>

572
00:48:20,272 --> 00:48:22,524
It's time, Shadow.

573
00:48:24,192 --> 00:48:28,280
Professor, is this really 
what Maria would have wanted?

574
00:48:31,074 --> 00:48:34,411
The question isn't what 
Maria would have wanted.

575
00:48:35,537 --> 00:48:37,539
It's what do they deserve.

576
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:41,043
Remember what she meant to us.

577
00:48:42,878 --> 00:48:45,797
Remember what they took from us.

578
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:57,309
Kids!

579
00:48:57,476 --> 00:48:59,394
We have to go, now!

580
00:49:04,608 --> 00:49:07,069
They want to take 
Shadow away from us, Maria!

581
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:18,372
Hey! Hey! What are you 
doing? Those are children.

582
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:20,332
- We've got our orders, Walters! 
- Stand down!

583
00:49:44,189 --> 00:49:45,399
Huh?

584
00:49:46,942 --> 00:49:48,026
Maria!

585
00:50:35,532 --> 00:50:38,535
Excuse me, Grand Paso Doble.

586
00:50:38,702 --> 00:50:41,663
What is that thermonuclear 
gerbil doing?

587
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:44,207
Infusing the core...

588
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,834
with chaos energy.

589
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,628
That's my little secret.

590
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:51,423
The Eclipse Cannon is 
about to turn this planet

591
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:54,384
into a flaming pile of rubble,

592
00:50:54,551 --> 00:50:59,389
wiping out everything 
in a 25,000-mile radius.

593
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,728
Including us.

594
00:51:08,648 --> 00:51:09,900
What?

595
00:51:10,817 --> 00:51:13,904
We can't annihilate the Earth!

596
00:51:14,071 --> 00:51:18,533
- Hmm? 
- By combining our genius, we can rule humanity.

597
00:51:18,700 --> 00:51:19,701
Together!

598
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,871
Humanity is a failed experiment.

599
00:51:23,038 --> 00:51:25,290
If anyone should 
know that, it's you.

600
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,920
All your life, you've been 
rejected by this world.

601
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,464
You have nothing down there.

602
00:51:34,049 --> 00:51:36,093
No one who cares about you.

603
00:51:37,886 --> 00:51:39,471
But I have you now.

604
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,558
We're family.

605
00:51:44,476 --> 00:51:46,061
We have each other.

606
00:51:47,562 --> 00:51:48,814
Oh, Ivo...

607
00:51:50,649 --> 00:51:52,359
you're no Maria.

608
00:51:55,695 --> 00:51:59,658
The moment I lost her, my 
family was gone forever!

609
00:52:01,326 --> 00:52:03,036
The only way to give 
Maria's life meaning

610
00:52:03,245 --> 00:52:05,497
is to destroy the world 
that took her from me.

611
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:08,500
So I'm burning it all down!

612
00:52:11,169 --> 00:52:12,379
It's done.

613
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,840
Good work, Shadow.

614
00:52:15,006 --> 00:52:16,883
I'm prepping the 
firing sequence.

615
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:20,929
The weapon will be fully 
charged in ten minutes.

616
00:52:24,891 --> 00:52:26,977
It's almost finished, Maria.

617
00:52:27,894 --> 00:52:30,272
You will have justice.

618
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:35,944
What is that?

619
00:52:36,862 --> 00:52:39,823
Is GUN launching missiles at us?

620
00:52:39,990 --> 00:52:43,034
Impossible. It's 
moving too fast.

621
00:52:46,288 --> 00:52:47,789
It's him.

622
00:52:56,298 --> 00:53:00,594
You hurt my family. 
This ends now!

623
00:53:00,760 --> 00:53:02,470
Now you know my anger.

624
00:53:02,637 --> 00:53:05,515
The pain I've felt for 50 years.

625
00:53:05,682 --> 00:53:08,935
And you've made the 
same choice I did.

626
00:53:09,102 --> 00:53:10,687
I'm nothing like you!

627
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:11,938
We'll see.

628
00:53:19,779 --> 00:53:21,406
Show yourself, coward!

629
00:53:53,188 --> 00:53:54,856
You were right about one thing.

630
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:59,069
This ends now.

631
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,721
What's happening?

632
00:54:26,888 --> 00:54:28,014
Where are they?

633
00:54:29,057 --> 00:54:30,308
- Up there. 
- Where?

634
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:31,518
- Higher. 
- Hmm?

635
00:54:33,144 --> 00:54:34,437
Left yourself open.

636
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:36,398
Ivo! What are you doing?

637
00:54:36,564 --> 00:54:37,941
Thwarting your evil plan!

638
00:54:48,868 --> 00:54:50,829
- Not the mustache! 
- Agreed.

639
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:53,707
Let go on three. 
One, two, three!

640
00:54:58,878 --> 00:55:02,132
Oh... a nano-fist.

641
00:55:02,299 --> 00:55:06,011
I haven't seen that since I 
hate-watched <i>Green Lantern</i> in 2011.

642
00:55:06,177 --> 00:55:08,138
I was saving it for Comic-Con.

643
00:55:08,305 --> 00:55:10,348
But now there won't 
be a Comic-Con!

644
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:36,041
Why are you alone? 
Where are your friends?

645
00:55:37,917 --> 00:55:40,295
They tried to stop 
you, didn't they?

646
00:55:40,503 --> 00:55:41,963
But you came anyway.

647
00:55:42,130 --> 00:55:44,591
Your anger was too much.

648
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,510
What kind of hero 
abandons his friends

649
00:55:47,677 --> 00:55:49,721
to pursue revenge?

650
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:18,416
Go ahead. Finish it!

651
00:56:19,626 --> 00:56:20,835
You didn't let your pain 
change who you are...

652
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,721
What are you doing?

653
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:34,766
You won. Take your revenge.

654
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:38,770
There are no winners 
with revenge.

655
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:14,389
This whole mess is my fault.

656
00:57:14,556 --> 00:57:17,392
I've been so blinded 
by rage, I thought...

657
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,853
I had no choice.

658
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:25,775
You always have a choice.

659
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:33,491
But making the right 
one is never easy.

660
00:57:33,658 --> 00:57:35,368
One more thing I learned

661
00:57:35,535 --> 00:57:38,288
is that when you really 
screw something up,

662
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:39,956
you can't fix it on your own.

663
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:12,030
I... will... not... 
try...

664
00:58:12,197 --> 00:58:15,158
to stop... my... 
elders... from...

665
00:58:15,325 --> 00:58:17,744
destroying... the... world!

666
00:58:23,374 --> 00:58:25,293
Playtime is over.

667
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,221
There's no going back now.

668
00:58:40,391 --> 00:58:42,769
Set up defense.

669
00:58:44,729 --> 00:58:46,022
Damn you, autocorrect!

670
00:58:51,903 --> 00:58:52,946
Mantis!

671
00:58:54,906 --> 00:58:56,157
Oh!

672
00:58:59,535 --> 00:58:59,702
Whee!

673
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,333
I'm right here, arach-nerd.

674
00:59:15,843 --> 00:59:18,555
That's what I call 
mantis-scaping.

675
00:59:18,763 --> 00:59:21,182
That's elder abuse!

676
00:59:27,272 --> 00:59:30,483
<i>Alert! Alert! Alert!</i>

677
00:59:30,650 --> 00:59:32,068
Shadow...

678
00:59:32,235 --> 00:59:34,862
I see you've chosen betrayal.

679
00:59:36,030 --> 00:59:38,658
And you were once 
so useful to me.

680
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,870
Please, Grampsy,

681
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,788
don't do this!

682
01:00:25,955 --> 01:00:28,041
Sorry, kiddo.

683
01:00:28,207 --> 01:00:31,419
Bring Your Grandkid 
to Work Day is over.

684
01:00:37,633 --> 01:00:39,385
Any last words?

685
01:00:39,552 --> 01:00:42,263
Just one thing...

686
01:00:43,264 --> 01:00:45,350
that I never thought I'd say.

687
01:00:45,516 --> 01:00:47,018
What is it?

688
01:00:47,185 --> 01:00:49,687
"I love you"?

689
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:51,647
No.

690
01:00:51,814 --> 01:00:53,733
It was something even better.

691
01:00:53,900 --> 01:00:56,110
But I'm not gonna say it if 
that's the way you're gonna be.

692
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,112
Okay. Bye.

693
01:01:11,000 --> 01:01:11,959
Grandchildren.

694
01:01:13,044 --> 01:01:16,673
All the fun and none 
of the responsibility.

695
01:01:18,800 --> 01:01:21,552
Who said life was pointless?

696
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:25,264
- Huh? 
- Oh, right. You did.

697
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:32,772
Victory!

698
01:01:32,814 --> 01:01:35,149
Say what you want 
about my granddad,

699
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:37,151
he made one hell 
of a bug zapper.

700
01:01:39,362 --> 01:01:41,197
We got to stop that laser!

701
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,574
I knew there was something 
I was forgetting.

702
01:02:10,768 --> 01:02:12,603
We can't stop the 
cannon from firing...

703
01:02:12,770 --> 01:02:14,856
But we can steer it 
away from the Earth.

704
01:02:15,064 --> 01:02:17,400
- Coming around to starboard. 
- Aye-aye, Doc.

705
01:02:21,362 --> 01:02:23,406
Here we go.

706
01:02:24,615 --> 01:02:26,492
It's a little tight.

707
01:02:27,243 --> 01:02:29,454
Definitely not power steering.

708
01:02:35,376 --> 01:02:38,296
Keep... turning.

709
01:02:40,882 --> 01:02:42,717
Jump in anytime here, guys!

710
01:03:05,156 --> 01:03:06,324
Yes!

711
01:03:06,491 --> 01:03:08,743
I did it! I did it!

712
01:03:12,038 --> 01:03:13,748
- Oh! 
- Ooh!

713
01:03:14,415 --> 01:03:15,541
Look what you did!

714
01:03:15,708 --> 01:03:18,336
- Hey, look down there! 
- Sonic!

715
01:03:24,425 --> 01:03:26,511
Oh, Knuckles, please 
tell me you have a...

716
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,387
Last one.

717
01:03:28,554 --> 01:03:29,931
Let's make it count.

718
01:03:32,517 --> 01:03:33,643
Ready for a little base of ball?

719
01:03:35,603 --> 01:03:37,188
Deep breath.

720
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:40,066
One... two... three!

721
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,048
- Really! 
- What's happening?

722
01:04:04,215 --> 01:04:06,717
The reactor core is overloading.

723
01:04:06,884 --> 01:04:09,220
It's only a matter of 
time before it blows.

724
01:04:09,428 --> 01:04:11,138
So what does that 
mean for Earth?

725
01:04:11,305 --> 01:04:13,975
A radioactive atmosphere.

726
01:04:14,141 --> 01:04:16,644
Rain that kills the crops 
and melts your flesh.

727
01:04:16,811 --> 01:04:18,062
Other than that...

728
01:04:18,229 --> 01:04:19,897
We're not done here!

729
01:04:20,064 --> 01:04:21,983
You try to stabilize 
the reactor.

730
01:04:22,149 --> 01:04:23,401
Buy me some time.

731
01:04:23,568 --> 01:04:25,611
I'll push the station 
away from Earth

732
01:04:25,778 --> 01:04:27,196
before it explodes.

733
01:04:27,405 --> 01:04:31,409
This is our last chance 
to do the right thing.

734
01:04:33,035 --> 01:04:35,663
Go with God

735
01:04:35,830 --> 01:04:38,040
stinking hedgehog.

736
01:04:39,292 --> 01:04:40,751
<i>Core integrity failing.</i>

737
01:04:50,803 --> 01:04:52,471
I've got you, Sonic!

738
01:05:25,796 --> 01:05:29,175
<i>Initializing 
reactor core stabilizers.</i>

739
01:05:47,902 --> 01:05:50,613
This is Doctor Ivo Robotnik,

740
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,532
dedicating my final livestream

741
01:05:53,699 --> 01:05:56,410
to one very special henchman:

742
01:05:57,036 --> 01:05:58,412
<i>Agent Stone.</i>

743
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,831
No, no. Doctor, wait!

744
01:06:00,998 --> 01:06:03,376
<i>If I can't rule the world...</i>

745
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:06,212
I might as well save it...

746
01:06:06,379 --> 01:06:09,548
for the one and only person 
who ever cared about me.

747
01:06:09,715 --> 01:06:11,634
Don't do this, Doctor, please!

748
01:06:11,801 --> 01:06:15,388
Stone, you were more 
than a sycophant to me.

749
01:06:18,265 --> 01:06:18,683
You were...

750
01:06:21,018 --> 01:06:21,644
a syco-friend.

751
01:06:28,109 --> 01:06:31,654
I'll miss your lattes with 
steamed Austrian goat milk.

752
01:06:33,614 --> 01:06:35,449
I love the way you make 'em!

753
01:07:18,576 --> 01:07:22,371
So... I guess there's only 
one thing left to say.

754
01:07:27,168 --> 01:07:28,669
It's been a real drag.

755
01:07:29,336 --> 01:07:30,838
Thanks for nothing.

756
01:07:49,398 --> 01:07:50,608
Sonic, look.

757
01:08:05,080 --> 01:08:06,707
Goodbye, Doctor.

758
01:08:22,556 --> 01:08:24,058
Let's do this!

759
01:08:24,225 --> 01:08:26,393
Yeah!

760
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:29,647
All right, 
boys, try and keep up.

761
01:10:26,096 --> 01:10:29,600
Sonic the Hedgehog is 
Family Champion once again!

762
01:10:30,267 --> 01:10:31,310
Tails?

763
01:10:32,311 --> 01:10:34,438
Knuckles?

764
01:10:35,064 --> 01:10:38,025
Okay. Yeah, I overshot 
the finish line.

765
01:10:46,951 --> 01:10:49,954
Okay, so 
how do I get back?

766
01:11:02,174 --> 01:11:03,092
Pro Tip

767
01:11:05,010 --> 01:11:06,637
you'd better not miss.

768
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:22,653
That's a neat trick.

769
01:11:34,581 --> 01:11:36,500
What? Who are you?
