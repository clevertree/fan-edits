# Sonic Trilogy - DeShwartzed Edition

## Description
The Sonic Movie Trilogy (2020-2024) is quite unwatchable 
due decisions by Ben Shwartz and other editors to add 
distracting, unamusing, racist, and otherwise agenda-driven dialog
in post-production. 
This project aims to restore the original vision of the live action Sonic Trilogy
before the project was sabotaged.

## Changes
All distracting dialogs are removed, while all plot points are retained.
I added four remixes to each movie from the corresponding Sonic game. 
Sonic 3 2024 included remixes from both Sonic 3 game and Sonic and Knuckles.

### Removals
Much of the Sonic sardonic commentary dialogue (voiced by Ben Shwartz) has been removed.
Some dialog of Knuckles, Tales, has been removed.
Nearly all dialogue and scenes with Wade and Rachel were removed.
Many sappy family scenes were removed.
