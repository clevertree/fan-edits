# Ari's Movie Fan Edit Project Files

This repo contains my collection of fan edits of various movies most of which I've watched countless times.
I felt like I know the movies so well at this point, including their cringe moments, that it was time to start making
my own edits. After all, I do plan to keep watching these movies until I die, right? Not to mention, I'd rather show 
this version to a friend or relative than the original (and force them to sit through some awful scenes). 
I am also making a small collection of 'kid friendly' cuts which remove all negative/questionable/horrific scenes entirely. 

## There are no copyrighted files in this repo
This repo only contains KDENLive project files. No media files are contained within the project files. 
No links are given to any copyright or pirated content. No clues are given as to how to find those links either.
I have one or more legitimate copies of every movie I edit. I'm hoping those who view my edits do as well.
Reminder: **We paid for all of this**. 
None of these movies would even exist, had we not paid full price for them in the past.
They belong to **us**. 

## Steps to render a movie edit from this repo
1. Grab your legal copy of the movie's DVD/Blu-ray
2. Use Handbrake or similar to rip a copy of your movie to a file (preferably x265/mp4)
3. Open KDENLive (free/open source editor) and load up the appropriate `.kdenlive` file. 
   Make sure to include any additional files. Sometimes OST songs or sound effects are required in the project file.
4. Optionally make your own changes and then, render the Fan Edit!

## Distribution

Sharing fan edits of movies between people who both own a copy of the original movie is 
**still illegal** however there has never been any real enforcement of this rule, and so the easiest way
to get a copy of my movies is to ask my in private message (on any social network).
