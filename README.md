# Ari's Movie Fan Edit Project Files

This repo contains my collection of fan edits of various movies most of which I've watched countless times.
I felt like I know the movies so well at this point, including their cringe moments, that it was time to start making
my own edits. After all, I do plan to keep watching these movies until I die, right? Not to mention, I'd rather show 
this version to a friend or relative than the original (and force them to sit through some awful scenes). 
I am also making a small collection of 'kid friendly' cuts which remove all negative/questionable/horrific scenes entirely. 

## There are no copyrighted files in this repo
This repo only contains KDENLive project files. No media files are contained within the project files. 
No links are given to any copyright or pirated content. No clues are given as to how to find those links either.
I have one or more legitimate copies of every movie I edit. I'm hoping those who view my edits do as well.
Reminder: **We paid for all of this**. 
None of these movies would even exist had we not paid full price for them in the past.
They belong to **us**. 

## Steps to render a movie edit from this repo
1. Grab your legal copy of the movie's DVD/Blu-ray
2. Use Handbrake or similar to rip a copy of your movie to a file (preferably x265/mp4)
3. Open KDENLive (free/open source editor) and load up the appropriate `.kdenlive` file. 
   Make sure to include any additional files. Sometimes OST songs or sound effects are required in the project file.
4. Optionally make your own changes and then, render the Fan Edit!

## Distribution

Sharing fan edits of movies between people who both own a copy of the original movie is 
**still illegal** however there has never been any real enforcement of this rule, and so the easiest way
to get a copy of my movies is to ask my in private message (on any social network).

## Banned from /r/FanEdit Subreddit for accusation of piracy.

Within the 2nd day of posting my fanedits I got perm banned, and they won't let me appeal. 
I can prove my copies weren't pirated. In fact I discuss buying the Spiritual Edition DVD from Ebay, which is allowed.
The deletion of my Sonic Trilogy edit was so blatant I had to wonder if they admins were doing the bidding of the hecklers, 
since they followed the heckler's extreme interpretation of racism in hollywood movies as some kind of conspiracy theory.
But this ban over piracy without asking me for a copy or checking with me at all is more than blatant - 
it's systematic, like the Combine-style destruction of Gaza. Alrighty then!
Now I see how locked-down the forum/discord/reddit channels are.
I figure there are industry agents at work here. I don't think that's much of a conspiracy really.
As hollywood continues to get worse, they are more afraid that we will eventually compete with them.
They don't even want us making edits. That much is clear.

Your post from fanedits was removed because of: '💼 Political / Religious Topics'

Hi u/Future-Ad756, Thank you for engaging with /r/fanedits. This subreddit is for discussing fanedits. Political or religious commentary about any party or ideology is considered off topic. Have a great day and happy editing and watching!

There was absolutely zero political/religious commentary in my post. Please review.

1:56 PM
Political topics include accusations of racism and other conspiracy theory based views.

Future-Ad756
1:58 PM
I didn't mention any racism or conspiracy thories. Can you please review the OP?
I linked to another movie subreddit. I didn't actually say anything about it myself.
Now why didn't you just ask me to remove the link to the subreddit? Wouldn't that have been much easier than deleting my post? I had 5 people who wanted links
Also why aren't you doing anything about the hecklers? I got attacked and you deleted my post. Are you the same person?

1:59 PM
Your edit decisions clearly state they are accusations of racism on the part of the lead actor. Your linking to conspiracy theory sites is a promotion of such. This subreddit does not support or allow such.

Future-Ad756
2:00 PM
So then I should just remove one sentence right?
Since that is your interpretation of accusations of racism and not anything specified in the rule list.
Bottom line, can I repost it without the subreddit liin or not?
