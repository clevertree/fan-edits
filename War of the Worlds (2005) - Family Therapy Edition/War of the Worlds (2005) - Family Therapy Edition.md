# War of the Worlds (2004) - Family Therapy Edition

## Change-list
This FanMix eliminates nearly all the toxic family behavior featured in the movie, 
so that WotW (2005) becomes a movie about aliens and not allusions to Spielberg's trouble raising his own children. 
Any scenes with tense, abrasive and/or childish behavior have been shortened where that behavior isn't being caused 
by the alien invasion. This edit also features music from Jeff Wayne's War of the Worlds Album, as well as the Orson 
Welles 1938 broadcast. Morgan Freeman's intro is replaced by that of Richard Burton. Other toxic behavior that is 
deemed out of place was also removed, like all dialog from Ray's friend's Vincent and Julio arguing about solar flares, 
or scenes with ...spongebob. Some alien sequences are removed, like alien death scene near the end, or the footage
of aliens ... traveling in lightning.

## Motivation
Aside from all the obvious problems with Spielberg's directing style, crappy pacing, and disrespect for tradition,
what really stuck out was how he portrayed Ray Ferrier's family. The toxicity portrayed by this family was out of 
place and distracting. Scary Movie 4 which came out the following year actually had a scene dedicated to pointing
out how ridiculous Ferrier's wife and children were behaving.
