1
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:20,557
Tell him to send it over 
to the cargo shed.

2
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:22,809
It's on its way.

3
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,031
Ray.

4
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,492
Ferrier. Whoa.

5
00:02:39,951 --> 00:02:43,121
I need you back in four instead of 12. 
I got half of Korea coming in at noon.

6
00:02:43,496 --> 00:02:46,749
No, no, no, I can't. 
I'm on a 12-hour blow. Call Tedesco.

7
00:02:47,125 --> 00:02:49,919
Come on. Tedesco can't move 
40 containers in an hour.

8
00:02:50,253 --> 00:02:52,297
I gotta have somebody 
who can do double picks.

9
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:55,842
I wish I could help you, Sal. 
It's the goddamn union regulations.

10
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:58,261
Come on. 
I'm in a position here, Ray.

11
00:02:58,595 --> 00:03:01,556
You remember 
the union regulations, Sal.

12
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:03,975
You know what your problem is?

13
00:03:04,267 --> 00:03:07,270
I can think of a couple women 
who'd be happy to tell you.

14
00:03:42,972 --> 00:03:45,642
<i>Three and two...</i>

15
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:15,129
Steven, look at this.

16
00:04:15,421 --> 00:04:17,840
- What's up? 
- Check it out!

17
00:04:21,386 --> 00:04:23,846
You ever see something like that?

18
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,557
Springtime, maybe. 
Not this time of year.

19
00:04:26,849 --> 00:04:29,560
Come on, we can see better 
from the back yard.

20
00:04:51,666 --> 00:04:53,710
You gotta come see this!

21
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,807
- That is so weird. 
- What?

22
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,476
The wind is blowing 
toward the storm.

23
00:05:10,768 --> 00:05:12,645
That is weird.

24
00:05:13,104 --> 00:05:14,814
Hey, watch it!

25
00:05:16,733 --> 00:05:19,569
Rachel, 
you wanna see something cool?

26
00:05:52,935 --> 00:05:54,354
It's okay.

27
00:05:54,812 --> 00:05:56,814
- I wanna go inside. 
- It's okay.

28
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,816
I wanna go inside.

29
00:05:59,609 --> 00:06:01,194
Okay, you go ahead.

30
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,490
That's enough weather for me.

31
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,326
Don't wanna go by myself.

32
00:06:12,121 --> 00:06:14,457
It's kind of fun, isn't it?

33
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:17,335
- No. 
- Come on, like the Fourth of July.

34
00:06:18,044 --> 00:06:21,255
<i>- No, it's not. 
- O, say can...</i>

35
00:06:31,516 --> 00:06:33,142
It's okay. You're fine.

36
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:35,728
- It hit right behind our house. 
- Yeah, well, it's...

37
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:37,730
It's not gonna hit there again, okay,

38
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:41,400
because lightning doesn't strike 
twice in the same place. Oh, shit!

39
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,075
Where's Robbie?

40
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,078
I don't know.

41
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,414
Is Robbie okay?

42
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:59,419
Are you okay?

43
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,546
Where's the thunder?

44
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,006
Why won't it stop?

45
00:07:18,062 --> 00:07:19,564
Is it over?

46
00:07:34,162 --> 00:07:36,247
Where are you going?

47
00:07:36,539 --> 00:07:40,293
Just... I'm just checking things out. 
Just wait... Wait there.

48
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:43,129
- Are we gonna be okay? 
- I don't know.

49
00:07:43,462 --> 00:07:45,381
- You don't know? 
- No, I meant, I just... Just...

50
00:07:45,673 --> 00:07:47,258
Rachel, please.

51
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:50,887
Just stop asking so many questions. 
Just wait here.

52
00:08:28,758 --> 00:08:30,843
Turn everything off.

53
00:08:31,135 --> 00:08:33,054
Everything is off.

54
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:36,599
I can't get one freaking thing 
to turn on.

55
00:08:38,601 --> 00:08:41,395
You believe this, Ray? 
Every single car.

56
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:45,107
Oh, Jesus. Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.

57
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:47,193
- The car just stopped, and... 
- You're okay?

58
00:08:47,485 --> 00:08:50,071
- Are you okay? You all right? 
- The lightning started to hit.

59
00:08:50,404 --> 00:08:52,365
- And me and this other guy... 
- Where the hell did you go?

60
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:55,034
- Over on Lincoln Avenue. 
- Lincoln Avenue?

61
00:08:55,368 --> 00:08:56,702
- By the church. 
- You saw the lightning?

62
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,120
Yeah, 26 times we counted, 
over and over again.

63
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,082
The lightning started to hit. 
It opened up this hole or something...

64
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:04,085
- Twenty-six times? 
- Yeah.

65
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:06,545
- You're okay? 
- Yeah.

66
00:09:06,796 --> 00:09:08,839
Good. All right, well, 
your sister is in the house,

67
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,218
and I want you to go in that house 
and I want you to stay with her, okay?

68
00:09:12,551 --> 00:09:16,180
The next time you take my car with 
no driver's license and no permission,

69
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,015
I call the cops.

70
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,311
You better be there when I get back.

71
00:09:23,187 --> 00:09:25,106
- Yeah. 
- Robbie.

72
00:09:30,152 --> 00:09:32,989
Manny, Manny. 
Manny, what is it, dead?

73
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:35,950
All of them. Everything. 
Look at this.

74
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,369
- The starter's fried. 
- Lightning hit it?

75
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:40,663
Not even close. 
I thought if I changed it...

76
00:09:41,122 --> 00:09:43,332
- Any idea what's going on? 
- I'm on my way to find out.

77
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:45,626
Try changing the solenoid. 
It's probably fried.

78
00:09:45,918 --> 00:09:48,462
Right, that's what I said. 
I told you that. The solenoid.

79
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,551
Hey, they're saying all the 
lightning struck down by the church.

80
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,856
What the hell is going on 
around here?

81
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:09,358
- Let us through. 
- Hey.

82
00:10:09,650 --> 00:10:10,818
- Let us through here. 
- Hey.

83
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:19,910
I never seen anything like this before.

84
00:10:20,202 --> 00:10:21,954
That many strikes of lightning 
in one spot?

85
00:10:22,622 --> 00:10:24,373
- Is this the only place? 
- Come on, put that down.

86
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:26,626
- You wanna step back, please? 
- Step back.

87
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:29,045
- You're gonna fall in. 
- Get back.

88
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:33,883
Back up, people. 
People, back up back there.

89
00:10:35,676 --> 00:10:38,512
Move back. Everybody back up.

90
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:40,306
Move back.

91
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,433
Move back.

92
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:47,355
- Is it hot? 
- Back up.

93
00:10:47,605 --> 00:10:49,273
- No. 
- Back up.

94
00:10:49,523 --> 00:10:51,192
- It's freezing. 
- What is that?

95
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,361
Oh, wait. Move. You feel that?

96
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,572
- I feel that. 
- Hey, Bobby, come check this out.

97
00:10:57,323 --> 00:10:58,532
- You feel that? 
- Feel that?

98
00:10:58,783 --> 00:11:00,368
- Yeah, I feel that. 
- What is it, the subway?

99
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:02,495
- There's no subway here. 
- F train, maybe?

100
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,205
That can't be the water main.

101
00:11:04,455 --> 00:11:05,706
There's nothing else down there.

102
00:11:05,956 --> 00:11:07,541
- Water main doesn't run through here. 
- Feel that?

103
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:09,460
There's something down there 
and it's moving.

104
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:16,884
Everybody move back.

105
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:19,178
Whoa. Back it up. Come on.

106
00:11:20,137 --> 00:11:21,555
Let's go.

107
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:24,767
Come on, folks. Back up. 
Get back.

108
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:35,611
Help me out here. Get back.

109
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:42,034
- Go! Move! 
- Everybody get out of the way!

110
00:11:42,326 --> 00:11:44,995
Everyone back up! 
Everyone clear the intersection!

111
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:49,208
Get out of the way! Back up! 
Back up! Get out of the way!

112
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:10,479
- Forget it! Get back! 
- Get the hell out of the street!

113
00:12:21,824 --> 00:12:23,367
Move away!

114
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,538
Come on, we gotta 
clear this area now!

115
00:13:17,922 --> 00:13:19,548
That's my car!

116
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,219
Go, go.

117
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,554
Get the hell out of here!

118
00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:51,622
Oh, my God!

119
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:53,749
Come on, people! Let's go!

120
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:55,668
Come on, back up!

121
00:13:55,918 --> 00:13:58,379
Please! Move back!

122
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,254
Watch it!

123
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,550
Oh, my God.

124
00:15:28,218 --> 00:15:30,387
Ray, no. Stay, man.

125
00:15:39,396 --> 00:15:41,231
Just stay.

126
00:15:41,523 --> 00:15:45,319
- Just stay back here. Stay back! 
- Wow.

127
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:02,252
Come on.

128
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,765
I don't think it's a fire.

129
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,685
- See? That looks like smoke to me. 
- What's happening?

130
00:17:42,144 --> 00:17:46,565
I can't tell you now. 
We've only got about another minute.

131
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,072
Please.

132
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,824
Please.

133
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:04,124
- Just keep it down. 
- Ray, I'm standing right beside you.

134
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,502
Can you please answer me?

135
00:18:08,212 --> 00:18:10,214
Just get in the front seat, Robbie.

136
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:16,845
- Whose car is this? 
- Just get in.

137
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,847
Whose car is this?

138
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:21,642
Hey. Hey, Ray. 
You were absolutely right.

139
00:18:21,642 --> 00:18:23,977
Hey. Hey, Ray. 
You were absolutely right.

140
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,688
That is exact... 
I had to change the solen...

141
00:18:27,940 --> 00:18:29,733
Ray? Hey.

142
00:18:30,025 --> 00:18:31,318
Hey, Ray? Ray.

143
00:18:31,318 --> 00:18:32,027
All right, get out of the truck. I'm not 
kidding now. Get out of the car, Ray.

144
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,071
I'm not gonna get in. 
I'm not getting in.

145
00:18:34,363 --> 00:18:36,824
- Manny, get in with us. 
- I'm not gonna get in trouble.

146
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:40,285
- Look, I'm not fooling around... 
- Close the door, Robbie. Close it.

147
00:18:41,245 --> 00:18:42,704
Ray, bring the car back, Ray. 
It's not my car.

148
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,210
Get down! 
Get down, get down! Get down!

149
00:18:48,210 --> 00:18:50,212
- Just get down. Get down! Get down! 
- Holy shit!

150
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,873
I wanna know everything you know.

151
00:19:26,874 --> 00:19:28,041
This...

152
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:30,002
This machine, 
it crawled out of the ground,

153
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:33,463
started torching everything. 
It was killing everybody.

154
00:19:44,266 --> 00:19:45,726
That machine,

155
00:19:46,018 --> 00:19:49,062
it was already buried.

156
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:51,565
Maybe it...

157
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:54,985
...it came down in the lightning storm.

158
00:19:55,986 --> 00:19:59,698
- They came down in a lightning storm. 
- What do you mean, came down?

159
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:02,451
- You said it was buried. 
- No, the machine I'm talking about

160
00:20:02,743 --> 00:20:05,829
was buried, but what 
came down in the lightning storm,

161
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:08,206
what operates it,

162
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:10,959
that's the... You know.

163
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,377
- The what? 
- That's...

164
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,047
Why aren't there any helicopters 
or airplanes?

165
00:20:30,020 --> 00:20:31,813
Robbie, get the door.

166
00:20:33,857 --> 00:20:35,400
Mom!

167
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:37,110
- Mom! 
- Mom!

168
00:20:37,361 --> 00:20:39,071
Mom!

169
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,741
Mom? Tim?

170
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:47,788
Mom? Tim?

171
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,334
- Mom? 
- Mom?

172
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:55,671
- Tim?! 
- Tim?

173
00:20:56,922 --> 00:20:58,757
Tim?

174
00:20:59,549 --> 00:21:01,218
Mom?

175
00:21:02,844 --> 00:21:04,096
They're gone.

176
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:06,181
Is she dead?

177
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,266
She's not dead. All right?

178
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:09,768
She's just not here, okay?

179
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:12,479
- They were never here. 
- How do you know?

180
00:21:12,813 --> 00:21:14,856
Because they're 
on their way to Boston.

181
00:21:15,148 --> 00:21:16,942
And so they just...

182
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:18,402
...kept on going up to Boston. 
Probably at your grandma's house.

183
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,736
...kept on going up to Boston. 
Probably at your grandma's house.

184
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:23,031
If everything's fine, why do we 
have to sleep in the basement?

185
00:21:23,323 --> 00:21:26,326
- We've got perfectly good beds. 
- Hey, it's like a slumber party.

186
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:28,078
What are you afraid 
is gonna happen?

187
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:29,663
Nice basement.

188
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:30,455
I wanna sleep in my bed. 
Got back problems.

189
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,827
Is the lightning back?

190
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:08,345
- What's that sound? 
- I've never heard that before!

191
00:23:08,637 --> 00:23:11,098
Is it them? Is it them?

192
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,058
We gotta go.

193
00:23:13,308 --> 00:23:14,976
Where do we go?! 
Robbie, this is your house.

194
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,311
Where do we go?!

195
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:30,987
Down here.

196
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,160
Were you on this plane?

197
00:25:38,536 --> 00:25:40,622
Are you...? 
Are you a passenger?

198
00:25:47,712 --> 00:25:50,465
How you doing? 
Wanna help me open this?

199
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,803
Are you a passenger?

200
00:25:55,095 --> 00:25:56,638
He's deaf.

201
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:00,392
The shell went off right beside him. 
Camera on his shoulder saved his life.

202
00:26:00,725 --> 00:26:02,018
You hear that, Max?

203
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,771
Your stupid camera 
saved your stupid life.

204
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,482
Where were you?

205
00:26:08,066 --> 00:26:09,901
Out there in the Pine Barrens.

206
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,654
We were attached to 
a National Guard unit.

207
00:26:12,904 --> 00:26:14,239
The 83rd Mechanized.

208
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,366
They moved on one of those things 
around midnight.

209
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,410
They got some kind of shield 
around them.

210
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:21,288
You can't see it, but everything we fire 
at them detonates too early,

211
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:24,249
before we can get close enough 
to cause any damage.

212
00:26:24,916 --> 00:26:28,545
When they flash that thing, 
everything lights up like Hiroshima.

213
00:26:29,379 --> 00:26:31,464
There's more than one?

214
00:26:32,674 --> 00:26:34,509
You gotta be kidding me, right?

215
00:26:35,802 --> 00:26:37,804
We were feeding New York, 
but New York went dark.

216
00:26:38,096 --> 00:26:40,348
So we patched over to D.C., 
they went down.

217
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,017
L.A., Chicago, uplinked to London.

218
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,226
L.A., Chicago, uplinked to London.

219
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:46,563
Even called the affiliates to try 
to get them to catch the feed,

220
00:26:46,896 --> 00:26:49,441
but nobody answers. 
It's the same everywhere.

221
00:26:49,733 --> 00:26:53,987
Once the Tripods start to move, 
no more news comes out of that area.

222
00:27:06,499 --> 00:27:08,293
You hear that?

223
00:27:08,585 --> 00:27:10,837
We're getting the hell out of here.

224
00:27:14,424 --> 00:27:16,051
Get in, get in, get in, get in.

225
00:27:17,761 --> 00:27:20,680
Hey, were you on that plane?

226
00:27:22,599 --> 00:27:25,727
That's too bad. 
It would've been a really great story.

227
00:27:27,854 --> 00:27:30,523
You're doing good. You're doing good. 
Keep your eyes on me.

228
00:27:30,899 --> 00:27:31,983
I'm going right to Boston.

229
00:27:32,275 --> 00:27:34,319
- We're gonna see your mom. 
- I'm not gonna look, Dad.

230
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:36,529
That's a girl. That's my girl. 
Now listen.

231
00:27:36,863 --> 00:27:38,490
- I want you to close your eyes, okay? 
- Okay.

232
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,992
Got them closed? There you go.

233
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:43,495
- Keep them closed for me. 
- Okay.

234
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:49,959
Robbie, get in.

235
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,381
Get in.

236
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,904
- Why aren't we on the turnpike? 
- I don't want everybody

237
00:28:18,196 --> 00:28:20,573
to see that we've got a working car. 
We'll stay along the Hudson

238
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:24,035
till we find an open bridge or ferry, 
then we're gonna cross the Hudson.

239
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:28,164
We'll take the back roads across 
Connecticut, all the way to Boston.

240
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:51,563
I'll close my eyes. 
Why don't you drive for a bit.

241
00:28:52,772 --> 00:28:54,733
I don't have a license.

242
00:28:55,942 --> 00:28:58,194
Since when has that stopped you?

243
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:30,560
Ray.

244
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:33,897
Ray! Dad!

245
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,231
Ray! Dad!

246
00:29:37,734 --> 00:29:39,903
You think you could...?

247
00:29:40,195 --> 00:29:42,739
You think you could...? 
Do you think you could...?

248
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:45,033
Don't stop.

249
00:29:45,325 --> 00:29:47,285
Don't take your foot off. Okay?

250
00:29:47,577 --> 00:29:49,120
I got it, but keep your foot on. 
Okay, I got it. I got it.

251
00:29:50,330 --> 00:29:53,374
- Where is everybody going? 
- I don't know, Rach.

252
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,585
But we do, right?

253
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:57,670
Yeah, we do.

254
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:13,770
- Be careful. 
- How'd you fix this?

255
00:30:14,062 --> 00:30:17,398
- How'd you fix the car? 
- Please! Why won't you help us?

256
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,194
I'm sorry, I can't. I can't.

257
00:30:21,486 --> 00:30:22,862
Please, get away from the car.

258
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,073
Hey! Stop the car.

259
00:30:25,406 --> 00:30:27,992
- Stop the car! 
- Get off the car!

260
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:30,995
You could carry 20 people in there!

261
00:30:31,329 --> 00:30:33,248
- Stop the car! 
- Get off the car!

262
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,124
Stop the car!

263
00:30:49,097 --> 00:30:50,139
Are you okay?

264
00:31:03,778 --> 00:31:05,530
No, wait! Wait!

265
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,199
No! Just wait! Okay! Wait! Stop!

266
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,285
- Just stop! 
- Daddy!

267
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:12,036
Rachel!

268
00:31:12,745 --> 00:31:14,414
Get out of there!

269
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,542
Robbie!

270
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,759
Robbie!

271
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,387
- Ray! 
- Get in the car!

272
00:31:34,517 --> 00:31:37,103
- Help! 
- Rachel! Get out of the car!

273
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:39,314
Rachel, get... 
Get out of the car.

274
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,899
- Get out! 
- Daddy!

275
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:51,409
- Take it easy! 
- Get off the car!

276
00:31:51,701 --> 00:31:53,036
Get off!

277
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,704
Get off the car! Move!

278
00:31:54,954 --> 00:31:56,581
Move!

279
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:58,583
- Where's my son? 
- You don't need that, man.

280
00:31:58,875 --> 00:32:01,252
- Where's my son? Robbie! 
- Cool down, man.

281
00:32:01,586 --> 00:32:03,379
- Put the gun down, man. 
- Robbie!

282
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:11,888
Okay, now, listen.

283
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:15,016
- Put down the gun. I'm taking the car. 
- My daughter's in the car.

284
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:17,226
- I'm taking the car, man. 
- Please. All I want...

285
00:32:17,518 --> 00:32:20,021
- Put down the goddamn gun! 
- All I want is my daughter.

286
00:32:20,355 --> 00:32:22,565
- I'm taking the car, man. 
- Please, I just want my daughter.

287
00:32:22,899 --> 00:32:24,776
Let me just take my daughter. 
Can I...?

288
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:28,029
- All I want is my daughter. 
- Yeah. Okay, go ahead, man.

289
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,281
Robbie.

290
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,627
Take me with you!

291
00:33:44,147 --> 00:33:45,982
Have you seen this girl? 
This is my daughter.

292
00:33:46,274 --> 00:33:48,025
He needs his medicine.

293
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,706
We've got it the worst, 
that's what I heard.

294
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,834
The U.S., mostly. 
South America and Asia, some.

295
00:34:05,168 --> 00:34:06,711
There's nothing going on in Europe.

296
00:34:07,003 --> 00:34:09,505
Europe got the worst of it, 
that's what everybody's saying.

297
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,008
- Completely wiped out some of it. 
- I don't give a shit who it is.

298
00:34:12,341 --> 00:34:14,594
I got up close to one of those things 
in Stanfordville.

299
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,471
If they're all over the place, 
we're dead.

300
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,390
- Looks like the power's still on here. 
- Yeah.

301
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:21,642
Yeah, power's still on.

302
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:24,937
Because nothing bad's come up 
from the ground.

303
00:34:25,271 --> 00:34:28,441
- Hold on. Hold on, move back! 
- Watch out there, lady!

304
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:29,734
I said, move back!

305
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:10,233
Unless you are O-positive 
and RH-negative,

306
00:35:10,566 --> 00:35:14,529
thank you very much, but we already 
have more blood than we can use.

307
00:35:14,904 --> 00:35:21,369
Again, if you are O-positive, 
RH-negative, identify yourselves.

308
00:35:21,828 --> 00:35:23,788
If you are not, thank you very much.

309
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,124
We already have more blood 
than we can use for the transfusions.

310
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,085
Let's go, folks.

311
00:35:29,377 --> 00:35:32,171
This way. This way. 
Keep it moving.

312
00:35:32,505 --> 00:35:36,342
Keep it moving. This way. 
Let's go, folks. Keep it moving.

313
00:35:36,717 --> 00:35:40,513
Please move forward calmly. 
The boat can make more than one trip.

314
00:35:40,888 --> 00:35:45,017
Please move forward calmly. 
Take your time. Don't rush.

315
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:47,562
Ray! Ray! Ray!

316
00:35:47,854 --> 00:35:50,106
- Sheryl? 
- Yeah. Hey.

317
00:35:50,398 --> 00:35:52,066
Oh, my gosh, is this your...?

318
00:35:52,358 --> 00:35:53,484
- Are these your kids? 
- Rachel.

319
00:35:53,734 --> 00:35:56,112
Hi, I'm Sheryl. 
This is my daughter, Nora.

320
00:35:56,445 --> 00:35:58,573
- Nora. I've heard about you, Nora. 
- Hi.

321
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:01,576
- This is my son, Robbie. 
- Just like Dad.

322
00:36:16,924 --> 00:36:19,886
- It's good to see you as well. 
- Trees are funny.

323
00:36:20,219 --> 00:36:24,182
We're gonna move a few cars out 
of the way to make some more space.

324
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,435
You're gonna have to give us 
a few minutes.

325
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:30,605
But don't worry, 
there'll be plenty of room for everybody.

326
00:36:31,063 --> 00:36:33,232
We got sick people here. 
Let us on.

327
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:11,646
Cast off. Get that ramp up.

328
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,815
Cast off now. Get that ramp up.

329
00:37:15,149 --> 00:37:16,234
Cast off.

330
00:37:16,525 --> 00:37:19,320
No more people. No more people. 
We're taking the ramp up.

331
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:48,140
Stay close. Stay close.

332
00:37:48,599 --> 00:37:51,143
Everybody stop. Everybody stop.

333
00:37:51,435 --> 00:37:53,854
- Wait, wait, wait. Just... 
- Back up. Back up.

334
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:56,232
- There's room. 
- Just stay back.

335
00:37:56,482 --> 00:37:57,900
No more room. 
There's no more room.

336
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,568
Just listen to me. 
There's three of us.

337
00:37:59,819 --> 00:38:01,988
- Five. There's only five of us. 
- There's no room.

338
00:38:02,279 --> 00:38:03,489
Okay, man, just don't push me.

339
00:38:03,739 --> 00:38:05,908
- Sir, there's no more room. 
- There's plenty of room.

340
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:08,369
- There's room for hundreds more. 
- Sir...

341
00:38:08,661 --> 00:38:09,745
- Everybody, wait. 
- Hold on.

342
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:11,288
- You just stay with me. 
- Okay.

343
00:38:11,539 --> 00:38:12,498
Grab my jacket.

344
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:14,208
Everybody back up.

345
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:15,459
Back up.

346
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:17,086
I got you, Ferrier.

347
00:38:17,336 --> 00:38:19,046
- Oh, Jesus. 
- You okay?

348
00:38:19,338 --> 00:38:20,298
- Yeah. 
- Come on.

349
00:38:20,548 --> 00:38:22,341
- Okay, Jesus. Oh, my God. 
- Come on.

350
00:38:23,092 --> 00:38:24,677
Watch out.

351
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:32,977
Come on.

352
00:38:34,520 --> 00:38:36,105
Oh, Ray.

353
00:38:36,355 --> 00:38:38,065
Ray!

354
00:38:39,191 --> 00:38:40,776
Come on. Come on.

355
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:44,530
Go. I can go with him.

356
00:38:45,031 --> 00:38:46,449
Sheryl?

357
00:38:46,866 --> 00:38:48,826
Go with them. Go.

358
00:38:49,118 --> 00:38:50,077
- Ray. 
- Sheryl?

359
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,871
- Everybody... 
- Sheryl?

360
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:54,832
- There's room on the boat. 
- Let us through, goddamn it.

361
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,084
- There's still room on the boat. 
- She's a child.

362
00:38:57,376 --> 00:38:58,669
- Robbie. 
- There's room on the...

363
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:02,006
There's still room on the boat. 
There's room on the boat.

364
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,763
- Robbie. 
- Just stay with me.

365
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:10,931
Stay with me, Robbie.

366
00:39:31,494 --> 00:39:33,829
Oh, my God.

367
00:39:52,807 --> 00:39:53,724
Robbie!

368
00:40:38,144 --> 00:40:39,979
Swim. Swim this way!

369
00:41:33,741 --> 00:41:36,660
- Robbie, help me with her. 
- Here, Rach.

370
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:41,957
Don't stop. Don't stop.

371
00:41:42,666 --> 00:41:44,251
Don't stop.

372
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:02,978
Oh, my God.

373
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,337
Robbie.

374
00:43:10,587 --> 00:43:12,298
Don't move. Don't move.

375
00:43:12,589 --> 00:43:15,259
Now for God's sake, stay right here. 
I'm coming right back.

376
00:43:15,593 --> 00:43:17,469
- Robbie! 
- Stop those people.

377
00:43:17,761 --> 00:43:19,638
- Turn around. Turn around. 
- Robbie.

378
00:43:20,472 --> 00:43:21,765
Robbie.

379
00:43:22,016 --> 00:43:23,183
Robbie.

380
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:24,560
What the hell?

381
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:26,770
Why are you doing this?

382
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:33,444
Pull back. 
Five hundred meters to my 10 o'clock.

383
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:37,698
Jekyll, no effect on target. 
No effect.

384
00:43:37,990 --> 00:43:38,991
Roger. No effect.

385
00:43:39,366 --> 00:43:41,994
Our mission, lieutenant, 
is to delay their advance

386
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:44,705
till those refugees get to safety. 
Now, keep firing.

387
00:43:47,249 --> 00:43:49,960
You've gotta listen. Turn around! 
I want you to listen to me.

388
00:43:53,172 --> 00:43:54,131
Listen to me.

389
00:43:54,381 --> 00:43:55,841
Go back down the hill!

390
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,260
All of you, just turn around!

391
00:44:12,483 --> 00:44:12,524
What are you doing here 
all by yourself?

392
00:44:13,025 --> 00:44:14,109
What are you doing here 
all by yourself?

393
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,861
Sweetie, you gotta come with us, 
please.

394
00:44:16,236 --> 00:44:17,446
- My dad's right there. 
- Please, come.

395
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,406
- Please, my dad's right there. 
- Listen to me...

396
00:44:19,698 --> 00:44:22,117
I need to be here. I want to see this.

397
00:44:22,618 --> 00:44:24,912
Wait. Wait... Just stay for Rachel. 
Stay for your sister.

398
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,582
Please, let me go. 
You need to let me go.

399
00:44:32,252 --> 00:44:33,212
All right. Okay. All right.

400
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:34,630
- You're coming with us. 
- Dad.

401
00:44:34,922 --> 00:44:36,674
- We're going now. 
- I can't.

402
00:44:36,965 --> 00:44:38,258
Dad!

403
00:44:42,304 --> 00:44:43,305
Dad.

404
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,558
Dad!

405
00:44:51,730 --> 00:44:54,483
Let me go! Dad!

406
00:44:56,819 --> 00:44:57,820
Guide on. Guide on.

407
00:44:58,112 --> 00:44:59,988
Black Six. Attack. Attack. Attack.

408
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:04,034
Stop.

409
00:45:04,368 --> 00:45:07,079
- That's my dad. 
- I'm her father. I'm her father.

410
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:09,248
- We're so sorry. 
- We thought she was alone.

411
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:12,835
- She was standing by the tree... 
- She's fine. Let's go! Let's go!

412
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:17,464
Robbie.

413
00:45:27,725 --> 00:45:30,060
Robbie!

414
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,705
Over here.

415
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:50,122
Over here!

416
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,587
Hurry.

417
00:46:16,356 --> 00:46:17,858
Are you all right?

418
00:46:18,192 --> 00:46:19,568
Hey.

419
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:23,822
What about you, huh?

420
00:46:37,503 --> 00:46:39,213
There you go.

421
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:42,758
Is that comfortable?

422
00:46:44,801 --> 00:46:47,262
I need you to close 
your eyes now, okay?

423
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:49,389
You need some sleep.

424
00:46:51,725 --> 00:46:53,101
Dad?

425
00:46:53,393 --> 00:46:55,020
He's gonna meet us.

426
00:46:56,230 --> 00:46:58,357
Hey. Robbie's gonna meet us, Rach.

427
00:46:58,649 --> 00:47:00,859
In Boston, at your grandma's.

428
00:47:01,193 --> 00:47:04,196
What do you think 
Mom's doing right this minute?

429
00:47:04,530 --> 00:47:05,906
Mom?

430
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,117
Boston. She's waiting.

431
00:47:09,618 --> 00:47:12,955
And I know she's not sleeping, 
because she is so worried about you.

432
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:14,790
And she's in Grandma's kitchen,

433
00:47:15,082 --> 00:47:16,458
and she's...

434
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,088
She's making that awful tea 
she makes.

435
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:23,173
And they're all just...

436
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:27,135
They're all just counting the minutes 
until they see you again.

437
00:47:29,513 --> 00:47:30,806
What is this?

438
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,349
What is this?

439
00:47:33,100 --> 00:47:34,142
I won.

440
00:47:34,434 --> 00:47:35,602
You won?

441
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,980
The walk, trot and canter.

442
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,148
Third place.

443
00:47:47,823 --> 00:47:49,408
Peach schnapps.

444
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,159
Disgusting, I know it.

445
00:47:51,451 --> 00:47:53,662
Found a whole case of this shit.

446
00:48:00,419 --> 00:48:02,045
Thank you.

447
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:09,303
I'm sorry about your son.

448
00:48:09,595 --> 00:48:11,096
We got separated. He's...

449
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:14,308
He's gonna meet us in Boston.

450
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:22,024
Did you...?

451
00:48:24,526 --> 00:48:26,695
Did you lose anybody?

452
00:48:28,822 --> 00:48:30,490
All of them.

453
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,829
Harlan Ogilvy.

454
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,248
Ray Ferrier.

455
00:48:38,498 --> 00:48:40,042
I got water.

456
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:43,503
Food enough for weeks.

457
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:47,049
You're welcome to stay. Both of youse.

458
00:48:47,382 --> 00:48:48,967
I'm sorry.

459
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:52,095
I'm gonna get some sleep.

460
00:48:53,930 --> 00:48:56,350
Those machines, those...

461
00:48:56,725 --> 00:48:58,769
...Tripods they got?

462
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,939
They buried them.

463
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:06,026
Right under our feet.

464
00:49:07,194 --> 00:49:09,112
Since before there...

465
00:49:09,571 --> 00:49:11,698
There were even people here.

466
00:49:12,574 --> 00:49:15,369
They've been planning this 
for a million years.

467
00:49:17,371 --> 00:49:18,789
We're beat to shit.

468
00:49:19,081 --> 00:49:20,123
Please.

469
00:49:20,415 --> 00:49:22,459
- My daughter... 
- Think about it.

470
00:49:25,796 --> 00:49:29,049
They defeated the greatest power 
in the world in a couple days.

471
00:49:29,424 --> 00:49:31,385
Walked right over us.

472
00:49:31,843 --> 00:49:34,554
And these are only the first. 
They'll keep coming.

473
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,349
This is not a war

474
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:40,435
any more than there's 
a war between men and maggots.

475
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:43,563
This is an extermination.

476
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:55,575
Are you afraid?

477
00:49:57,327 --> 00:49:58,120
Of course I am.

478
00:50:01,665 --> 00:50:03,959
I been around death plenty.

479
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:06,753
I drive an ambulance in the city...

480
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,339
Drove an ambulance in the city.

481
00:50:09,673 --> 00:50:11,967
That's all over now, huh?

482
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:17,848
You know the people 
that make it, Ray?

483
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,601
The ones that don't flatline 
before the hospital?

484
00:50:24,229 --> 00:50:27,107
It's the ones 
that keep their eyes open.

485
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:29,192
That keep looking at you.

486
00:50:29,443 --> 00:50:30,986
Keep thinking.

487
00:50:31,236 --> 00:50:33,488
They're the ones that survive.

488
00:50:35,240 --> 00:50:37,492
We can't lose our heads, Ray.

489
00:50:39,494 --> 00:50:40,162
Running.

490
00:50:41,663 --> 00:50:43,540
That's what'll kill you.

491
00:50:45,250 --> 00:50:47,711
And I'm dead set on living.

492
00:50:53,216 --> 00:50:55,385
Dead set on living...

493
00:50:58,138 --> 00:51:00,432
Thank you for taking us in.

494
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:09,691
Not gonna be exterminated.

495
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:27,125
It's okay. Come on.

496
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:29,044
I wanna show you something.

497
00:51:30,045 --> 00:51:31,463
We're gonna fight them, Ray.

498
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:32,881
They gotta have a weakness.

499
00:51:33,131 --> 00:51:34,674
Come on. Take a look.

500
00:51:42,599 --> 00:51:44,810
Somehow they killed 
a few of these things in Osaka.

501
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:46,102
That's what I heard.

502
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:48,647
You telling me the Japanese 
can figure it out, but we can't?

503
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:50,273
We can do this, Ray.

504
00:51:50,565 --> 00:51:52,234
We can do it. We can get them.

505
00:51:52,526 --> 00:51:54,277
We can figure it out.

506
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,655
Stay right there.

507
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:17,759
I have a daughter.

508
00:52:18,051 --> 00:52:19,344
Why did you bring us here?

509
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:22,180
To fight them together, Ray.

510
00:52:22,556 --> 00:52:25,851
Now we'll be the ones coming up 
from underground.

511
00:52:27,561 --> 00:52:28,687
When the time is right...

512
00:52:29,563 --> 00:52:31,731
...take them by surprise, 
the way they took us.

513
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,985
Take them by surprise.

514
00:52:36,236 --> 00:52:37,487
We're right under their feet, Ray.

515
00:52:37,779 --> 00:52:40,532
Right here. Under their feet.

516
00:53:29,247 --> 00:53:31,124
You miss your mommy?

517
00:53:31,917 --> 00:53:33,960
I had a little girl.

518
00:53:34,753 --> 00:53:36,129
Nearly your age.

519
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,799
You know, if anything happens 
to your daddy,

520
00:53:40,091 --> 00:53:41,635
I'll take care of you.

521
00:53:41,885 --> 00:53:43,261
Rachel.

522
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,313
You don't have 
anything to say to her.

523
00:53:53,605 --> 00:53:55,106
Do you understand?

524
00:53:55,857 --> 00:53:57,442
If you wanna talk to somebody,

525
00:53:57,692 --> 00:53:59,194
if you wanna ask a question, 
you ask me.

526
00:53:59,444 --> 00:54:01,821
What exactly is your plan, Ray?

527
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:04,908
I know what I'm gonna do. 
How about you?

528
00:54:05,241 --> 00:54:08,203
You gonna sit here? 
Wait for them to come get you?

529
00:54:08,536 --> 00:54:10,247
Is that your plan?

530
00:54:11,122 --> 00:54:14,167
Maybe you wanna get caught.

531
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:17,087
Couple days hiding in a basement 
too much for you, I bet.

532
00:54:18,338 --> 00:54:19,923
You'll probably turn yourself right in.

533
00:54:24,135 --> 00:54:25,428
Listen.

534
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,056
It stopped.

535
00:54:28,306 --> 00:54:29,557
Maybe you'll be okay.

536
00:54:29,808 --> 00:54:32,435
Maybe you'll get lucky, 
and they'll train you as their pet.

537
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,563
You know, feed you, 
train you how to do tricks.

538
00:56:33,264 --> 00:56:34,432
<i>No.</i>

539
00:56:37,102 --> 00:56:38,561
<i>No. No.</i>

540
00:56:40,105 --> 00:56:41,314
No.

541
01:01:39,320 --> 01:01:41,864
Ray. Ray.

542
01:01:42,156 --> 01:01:44,784
Ray. Ray. Ray!

543
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:46,536
Ray!

544
01:01:46,786 --> 01:01:49,539
Keep your voice down. Quiet!

545
01:02:31,080 --> 01:02:33,666
Not my blood. Not my blood.

546
01:02:36,752 --> 01:02:38,588
Not my blood.

547
01:02:39,672 --> 01:02:41,591
Not my...

548
01:02:42,049 --> 01:02:43,468
Not...

549
01:02:44,635 --> 01:02:45,928
...my...

550
01:02:48,222 --> 01:02:49,974
Not my blood.

551
01:02:50,808 --> 01:02:52,143
Not my blood.

552
01:02:52,393 --> 01:02:53,895
Not my blood.

553
01:02:54,145 --> 01:02:55,438
Not my blood.

554
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,315
Not my blood.

555
01:02:57,565 --> 01:02:59,066
- Not my blood. 
- Stop it.

556
01:02:59,317 --> 01:03:00,735
- Stop it. 
- Not my blood.

557
01:03:01,027 --> 01:03:02,195
- Stop it. 
- Not my blood.

558
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:03,863
You gotta be quiet.

559
01:03:04,155 --> 01:03:05,907
- You want them to hear you? 
- They drink us.

560
01:03:06,199 --> 01:03:07,992
- Please, they'll hear you. 
- They drink us.

561
01:03:08,284 --> 01:03:11,037
Then they spray us, like fertilizer.

562
01:03:11,370 --> 01:03:12,580
You gotta be quiet.

563
01:03:12,830 --> 01:03:15,416
- Drink us, and... 
- They're gonna come back down here.

564
01:03:15,750 --> 01:03:17,794
Then they spit us out all over 
the goddamn red weeds.

565
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,630
Do you understand 
what I'm gonna have to do?

566
01:03:20,922 --> 01:03:22,548
I can't let my daughter die 
because of you.

567
01:03:22,840 --> 01:03:24,675
This tunnel will get us to the city.

568
01:03:24,967 --> 01:03:26,552
We'll have tunnels there. 
Ready-made.

569
01:03:26,844 --> 01:03:28,304
- Stop it. 
- Subway. See what I'm saying?

570
01:03:28,596 --> 01:03:29,805
- Hide an army down there. 
- Stop it.

571
01:03:30,097 --> 01:03:31,557
We'll go underground. 
Sneak attacks at night.

572
01:03:31,849 --> 01:03:33,184
You stop it!

573
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,189
We're the resistance, Ray. 
They can't occupy this country.

574
01:03:38,523 --> 01:03:41,734
Occupations always fail. History's 
taught us that a thousand times.

575
01:03:42,109 --> 01:03:44,278
This is our land.

576
01:03:44,612 --> 01:03:47,657
We eat it, we breathe it, 
only we can live on it.

577
01:03:47,990 --> 01:03:50,618
They can't survive here, Ray. 
They weren't built for it.

578
01:03:51,994 --> 01:03:53,120
They're gonna kill you, brother, 
not me!

579
01:03:54,330 --> 01:03:56,624
- What are you doing, Dad? 
- Not my blood!

580
01:03:56,958 --> 01:03:59,919
Whatever you hear, 
don't take this off.

581
01:04:00,294 --> 01:04:01,671
- Dad? 
- Rach?

582
01:04:01,963 --> 01:04:04,173
- Dad? 
- What was that song?

583
01:04:04,507 --> 01:04:07,885
- That lullaby that I didn't know? 
- Not my blood!

584
01:04:08,261 --> 01:04:09,971
- "Hushabye Mountain"? 
- Yeah, sing it.

585
01:04:10,263 --> 01:04:12,890
- They can take you! 
- Please, Rach, sing it.

586
01:04:13,224 --> 01:04:16,227
<i>- They can take you! 
- A gentle breeze</i>

587
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:18,062
- Your daughter! 
- Don't stop.

588
01:04:18,354 --> 01:04:20,690
<i>- Not me! 
- On Hushabye Mountain</i>

589
01:04:21,023 --> 01:04:22,525
- They're gonna kill you! 
- That's my girl.

590
01:04:22,817 --> 01:04:27,196
<i>Softly blows over Lullaby Bay</i>

591
01:04:27,905 --> 01:04:31,993
<i>- Forget it! Tunnel! 
- It fills the sails</i>

592
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:35,663
<i>Of boats that are waiting</i>

593
01:04:37,498 --> 01:04:42,169
<i>Waiting to sail 
Your worries away</i>

594
01:06:32,530 --> 01:06:34,031
Rachel?

595
01:06:34,615 --> 01:06:36,117
Rachel?

596
01:06:36,909 --> 01:06:38,744
Oh, my God, no.

597
01:06:42,331 --> 01:06:43,749
Rachel?

598
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:45,501
Rachel? Rachel?

599
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:59,265
Rachel? Make some noise, baby.

600
01:06:59,598 --> 01:07:00,558
Rachel?

601
01:07:02,435 --> 01:07:04,145
Rachel?

602
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,318
Rachel? Talk to me, baby. Come on.

603
01:07:15,197 --> 01:07:17,074
Rachel?

604
01:07:19,910 --> 01:07:21,871
Rachel?

605
01:07:35,676 --> 01:07:37,511
Rachel?

606
01:07:37,762 --> 01:07:39,513
Rachel!

607
01:08:46,330 --> 01:08:48,249
No, no, no!

608
01:08:48,582 --> 01:08:49,959
No!

609
01:09:20,823 --> 01:09:22,741
Hey!

610
01:09:59,111 --> 01:10:01,822
What is happening?

611
01:10:04,491 --> 01:10:05,451
Rachel!

612
01:10:37,399 --> 01:10:39,068
Rachel.

613
01:10:39,318 --> 01:10:42,154
Rachel. Rachel.

614
01:10:42,947 --> 01:10:44,782
Rachel.

615
01:10:46,075 --> 01:10:47,952
Rachel?

616
01:10:49,161 --> 01:10:50,913
Rachel.

617
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:52,790
Dad.

618
01:11:20,109 --> 01:11:21,694
No!

619
01:11:22,778 --> 01:11:25,239
Pull me! Pull me!

620
01:11:32,121 --> 01:11:34,498
Pull! Pull!

621
01:11:34,790 --> 01:11:37,251
Pull me! Come on, pull!

622
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:43,090
- Dad! 
- One, two, three!

623
01:11:43,382 --> 01:11:46,593
We got him! Keep pulling!

624
01:11:53,892 --> 01:11:56,353
Everybody down!

625
01:12:48,989 --> 01:12:50,407
Keep it moving, folks.

626
01:12:53,577 --> 01:12:55,829
Keep going, sir. Keep moving.

627
01:12:56,163 --> 01:12:58,540
I don't know what's going on.

628
01:13:00,542 --> 01:13:02,378
Hold Grandma's hand.

629
01:13:04,546 --> 01:13:07,841
Let's go, folks. 
Keep moving forward.

630
01:13:18,268 --> 01:13:19,937
Put that down.

631
01:13:22,523 --> 01:13:25,234
Right this way, ma'am. 
Right this way, thank you.

632
01:13:33,492 --> 01:13:36,286
To the left, there, ma'am, 
just to your left. Thank you.

633
01:13:38,539 --> 01:13:40,499
What happened to it?

634
01:13:44,711 --> 01:13:46,130
It's dying.

635
01:13:48,715 --> 01:13:50,300
Keep moving forward.

636
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,271
Keep moving, it's all right!

637
01:14:02,521 --> 01:14:04,148
You can pass on through. 
Move along!

638
01:14:04,398 --> 01:14:05,649
- What happened here? 
- I don't know.

639
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:07,734
Something's happening to them. 
Please, keep moving.

640
01:14:07,985 --> 01:14:09,445
- Let's go, move out. 
- Let's go, people.

641
01:14:09,695 --> 01:14:12,656
- Something's happening to them? 
- Go. Go, just keep moving, sir.

642
01:14:12,990 --> 01:14:15,451
Let's go, sir. Let's go. Do not stop. 
Keep moving. Keep moving.

643
01:14:15,742 --> 01:14:17,828
Excuse me. What's happened here? 
Did you guys take it down?

644
01:14:18,120 --> 01:14:20,205
No, sir, it was behaving erratically, 
walking in circles,

645
01:14:20,497 --> 01:14:22,249
then it went down on its own 
about an hour ago.

646
01:14:22,541 --> 01:14:25,210
Now, please, let's go! Let's go! 
Keep moving! Come on! Don't stop!

647
01:14:25,502 --> 01:14:27,463
Do not stop! Let's go! Thank you!

648
01:14:29,047 --> 01:14:30,841
How is it dead all by itself?

649
01:14:31,133 --> 01:14:33,552
- Rachel, I'm not sure. 
- Coming through.

650
01:14:33,844 --> 01:14:36,763
Coming through. Make a hole. 
Coming through.

651
01:14:56,867 --> 01:14:58,994
Calm down. 
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

652
01:14:59,286 --> 01:15:02,289
Calm down and get in the tunnel. 
Calm down and get in the tunnel.

653
01:15:16,887 --> 01:15:18,013
It's safer in here.

654
01:15:18,263 --> 01:15:20,015
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

655
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:21,808
Bring out the Javelin!

656
01:15:30,442 --> 01:15:32,611
Clear! Get from behind! Clear!

657
01:15:41,954 --> 01:15:44,164
- Let me know when you're tracking! 
- Tracking!

658
01:15:44,498 --> 01:15:45,082
- You got a lock? 
- I got a lock!

659
01:15:46,291 --> 01:15:47,876
Fire the Javelin!

660
01:15:54,758 --> 01:15:56,969
- I got a lock! 
- Fire the Javelin!

661
01:16:00,305 --> 01:16:01,640
Fire!

662
01:16:16,154 --> 01:16:17,823
It's okay.

663
01:16:19,116 --> 01:16:20,867
I love you.

664
01:16:21,159 --> 01:16:23,662
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay. 
- Let's go!

665
01:16:25,205 --> 01:16:27,165
Keep those civilians out of there.

666
01:16:27,499 --> 01:16:31,169
Back. Stay back! 
Come on, folks, back up!

667
01:16:36,383 --> 01:16:39,511
Come on, guys, get on the line. 
Get up there now.
