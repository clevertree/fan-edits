# The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) - Carolyn Fry Edition

## Description
This version removes many extended scenes and restores some audio from the Theatrical version. 
It also removes many poorly acted, sexist, or just irritating scenes with 
Thandiwe Newton (Dame Vaako) and Alexa Davalos (Kyra).

## Motivation
I don't think anyone expected a sequel to Pitch Black (2000) to be any good, but I was impressed with many aspects of it,
just as I found Dark Fury and the PC games are rather impressive. Still, I found TCoR (2004) and Riddick (2013) movies to
be sleazy and lacking in the character balance that PB had. There was no mention of the protagonist of PB - Carolyn Fry.
The character Jack/Jackie was ruined into Kyra and eventually killed off.
A new female lead was introduced - Dame Vaako - who was just damned awful in both acting and character.
The extended version of TCoR (2004) was far worse.
There was extra sleaze, and extra generic holy-wood prophecy/vision sequences that ruined the pacing of the original
Theatrical version. Over the years I preferred watching the (rare) Theatrical DVD of TCoR (2004) instead of the high-def
blu-ray of the Extended version. As usual, the Theatrical version did not get a blu-ray upgrade. I decided to cut the
Blu-ray extended into a high-def theatrical version as best I can, leaving in the unproblematic extended sequences.
I further decided to remove all distracting sequences involving Dame Vaako to make the character more of a bystander,
rather than an ambitious idiot. Essentially I imagined how Carolyn Fry would have preferred TCoR (2004) to be edited -
less sleaze, more plot.
