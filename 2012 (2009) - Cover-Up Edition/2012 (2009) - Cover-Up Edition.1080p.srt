1
00:01:41,976 --> 00:01:44,062
Hey, hey, watch out. Watch out.

2
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:49,984
Welcome, my friend.

3
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:51,236
Great to see you.

4
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,279
Yeah, glad you made it.

5
00:01:53,863 --> 00:01:56,699
This can't be Ajit. 
He's a little man already.

6
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:59,202
- Unbelievable. 
- I hope you're hungry, Adrian.

7
00:01:59,369 --> 00:02:01,663
I'm famished. How are you, Aparna?

8
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:04,332
- I made that fish curry you love. 
- I can't wait.

9
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:08,002
She gets more beautiful 
every time I see her. Why is that?

10
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:11,840
Strange, isn't it? 
But her fish curry is still awful.

11
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:16,511
You were mysterious on the phone. 
Why didn't you attend the conference?

12
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:20,515
- I will show you, Adrian, sir. 
- Satnam, stop "siring" me.

13
00:02:27,438 --> 00:02:29,232
How deep do we need to go?

14
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,775
Eleven thousand feet.

15
00:02:31,651 --> 00:02:34,404
I searched all over India 
for this thing.

16
00:02:34,696 --> 00:02:37,365
Used to be the deepest copper mine 
in the world.

17
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:44,330
Remember my brother, Gurdeep? 
He's a student now.

18
00:02:44,539 --> 00:02:46,416
Namaste, Dr. Helmsley, sir.

19
00:02:46,583 --> 00:02:49,043
Adrian. It's just Adrian.

20
00:02:51,546 --> 00:02:53,798
Just don't pour too much, huh?

21
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:58,052
How do you work in this heat?

22
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,929
You've come on a good day, 
my friend.

23
00:03:00,096 --> 00:03:03,016
Sometimes it can hit 120 degrees.

24
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:05,518
You have to come and meet 
Dr. Lokesh...

25
00:03:05,685 --> 00:03:08,479
...a Fellow of quantum physics 
at the university in Chennai.

26
00:03:08,646 --> 00:03:10,607
Dr. Helmsley.

27
00:03:12,609 --> 00:03:15,028
So, what are we looking at?

28
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:16,905
These are neutrinos acting normally.

29
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:20,074
Minuscule mass, 
no electrical charge.

30
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,744
They pass through ordinary matter 
almost undisturbed.

31
00:03:22,911 --> 00:03:25,079
Your message said the count doubled 
after the last solar eruptions.

32
00:03:26,164 --> 00:03:28,166
That was last week.

33
00:03:29,125 --> 00:03:31,544
But this happened two days ago.

34
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:39,219
The biggest Sun eruptions 
in human history...

35
00:03:39,385 --> 00:03:42,430
...causing the highest neutrino count 
we've ever recorded.

36
00:03:43,306 --> 00:03:44,933
My God.

37
00:03:48,186 --> 00:03:49,812
That's not what worries me, Adrian.

38
00:03:51,272 --> 00:03:53,274
For the first time ever...

39
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:56,986
...the neutrinos are causing 
a physical reaction.

40
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:01,616
That's impossible.

41
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,622
That feels very good.

42
00:04:09,415 --> 00:04:12,043
Please, follow me.

43
00:04:15,755 --> 00:04:17,674
You won't believe this.

44
00:04:19,425 --> 00:04:22,971
This water tank goes down 
another 6000 feet.

45
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:26,432
It looks like the neutrinos 
coming from the Sun...

46
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:30,144
...have mutated into a new kind 
of nuclear particle.

47
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:39,654
They're heating up 
the Earth's core...

48
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,615
...and suddenly act like microwaves.

49
00:04:55,378 --> 00:04:58,798
Ladies and gentlemen, 
as promised, no speech...

50
00:04:59,674 --> 00:05:01,843
...just a thank-you...

51
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,762
...because tonight, 
with your extraordinary generosity...

52
00:05:04,929 --> 00:05:08,599
...we have raised $1.7 million.

53
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,020
Have a stiff drink, 
because I'm locking the doors...

54
00:05:12,186 --> 00:05:15,273
- ... and passing the hat around again. 
- It's okay. It's okay.

55
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,442
- I work for the White House. 
- I don't care.

56
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:19,569
This is a black-tie event.

57
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:21,487
Scotty.

58
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:25,366
Hey. Adrian, I thought you were 
in India. What's going on?

59
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:27,201
- I need yourjacket. 
- What?

60
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:30,246
I gotta speak to Anheuser. 
Give me your damn jacket, please.

61
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:31,748
- All right. 
- Okay?

62
00:05:31,914 --> 00:05:34,584
- All right, here. Here. 
- Hold that for a minute, will you?

63
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,964
Hey! Easy, that's a $600 jacket.

64
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:43,134
Mr. Anheuser?

65
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,552
Mr. Anheuser.

66
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,722
I need to talk to you.

67
00:05:50,725 --> 00:05:51,976
- Do I know you? 
- Sorry, sir.

68
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,561
My name's Dr. Adrian Helmsley.

69
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:57,690
I'm a deputy geologist at the Office 
of Science and Technology Policy.

70
00:05:58,399 --> 00:06:00,234
Excuse me, fellas.

71
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:04,322
You know that this is a fundraiser, 
not a frat party, right?

72
00:06:04,489 --> 00:06:06,866
- It's important, sir. 
- You know what? It always is.

73
00:06:07,075 --> 00:06:09,535
Make an appointment with my... 
You know, even better:

74
00:06:09,744 --> 00:06:12,288
Have your boss bring it up 
at the quarterly briefing.

75
00:06:12,455 --> 00:06:14,207
There's a good plan.

76
00:06:14,624 --> 00:06:16,959
I just traveled 20 straight hours 
to get here, sir.

77
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,878
I haven't slept in two days.

78
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:22,590
You need to read this, sir. 
You need to read it now.

79
00:06:27,762 --> 00:06:31,182
Let me guess, 
national geology crisis?

80
00:06:32,183 --> 00:06:33,351
Excuse me.

81
00:06:51,494 --> 00:06:53,955
- Who do you report to? 
- Lee Cavazos.

82
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,082
Not anymore.

83
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:01,254
Alan, bring the car around.

84
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:03,673
- You're gonna wish you took a shower. 
- Sir?

85
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:05,550
You're about to meet the president.

86
00:07:05,716 --> 00:07:06,926
What's going on?

87
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,053
Get that to the office.

88
00:07:25,486 --> 00:07:26,487
Good morning.

89
00:07:26,988 --> 00:07:30,199
I would like to meet privately 
with my fellow heads of state.

90
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,788
Mr. Makarenko wishes 
to have his interpreters present.

91
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:39,000
Mr. President, I can assure you...

92
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:43,629
...your English is more than sufficient 
for what I have to say.

93
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:04,734
Mr. Presidents.

94
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,948
Six months ago...

95
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:15,244
...I was made aware of a situation 
so devastating...

96
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:19,040
...that, at first, I refused to believe it.

97
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,250
However...

98
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:24,295
...through the concerted efforts...

99
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:27,006
...of our brightest scientists...

100
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:31,052
...we have confirmed its validity.

101
00:08:32,929 --> 00:08:36,849
The world as we know it...

102
00:08:38,392 --> 00:08:40,728
...will soon come to an end.

103
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:02,977
Has His Highness had an opportunity 
to study the dossier?

104
00:10:07,231 --> 00:10:11,068
You must understand, 
I have a very big family, Mr...?

105
00:10:11,819 --> 00:10:13,154
Isaacs.

106
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,823
One billion dollars is a lot of money.

107
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:21,829
I'm afraid the amount is in euros, 
Your Highness.

108
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,663
This mass suicide was actually 
discovered by a documentary crew...

109
00:11:45,830 --> 00:11:48,124
...here in the ancient Mayan city 
of Tikal.

110
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:50,292
Now, the victims, 
and we've seen many...

111
00:11:50,459 --> 00:11:53,170
...are said to have adhered 
to the Mayan-Quiche calendar...

112
00:11:53,337 --> 00:11:55,423
...which predicts 
the end of time to occur...

113
00:11:55,589 --> 00:11:57,800
...on the 21st of December 
of this year...

114
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:00,010
...due to the Sun's 
destructive forces.

115
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,262
Thank you, Mark.

116
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,140
Strangely enough, 
scientific records do support the fact...

117
00:12:05,808 --> 00:12:09,395
...that we are heading for the biggest 
solar climax in recorded history.

118
00:12:13,733 --> 00:12:14,775
Well, yes.

119
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:18,779
Apparently many people believe 
that the Mayan calendar predicts...

120
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:21,490
...that there's supposed 
to be a galactic alignment...

121
00:12:21,657 --> 00:12:22,700
I'm a dead man.

122
00:12:22,867 --> 00:12:25,703
I'm a dead man. I'm a dead man.

123
00:12:25,870 --> 00:12:29,165
...it's the end of the world in 2012.

124
00:12:29,331 --> 00:12:31,333
Goddamn it.

125
00:12:35,796 --> 00:12:39,133
Hey, Kate. I'm practically 
on the freeway right now.

126
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:42,720
Yes, I'm hurtling toward you 
as we speak.

127
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:46,056
Will you relax? 
Yeah, I'll be there any second.

128
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:50,269
You know it's a vacation 
and not a doctor's appointment, right?

129
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:51,979
That it's supposed to be fun?

130
00:12:52,146 --> 00:12:54,106
You remember fun, don't you, Kate?

131
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:57,860
Do you remember where you were 
when it stopped being fun for you?

132
00:12:59,403 --> 00:13:01,489
Yeah. I got it.

133
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:09,955
Bug spray? Oh, yeah, because 
it's mosquito season in Yellowstone.

134
00:13:10,122 --> 00:13:14,710
I got a whole bunch. Okay, I gotta go, 
because I'm in a bad-reception area.

135
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,510
Whoa, man.

136
00:13:22,676 --> 00:13:24,470
Would you look at that?

137
00:13:24,678 --> 00:13:26,055
Sick.

138
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:33,604
Merrill, I told you.

139
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,607
We have to move back 
to Wisconsin.

140
00:13:36,774 --> 00:13:40,110
Yeah, but these little mini-quakes 
are really getting on my nerves.

141
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:43,364
A little surface crack? You're not 
gonna be inconvenienced by that.

142
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:46,158
Right, surface cracks. 
I got a plastic surgeon for that.

143
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,619
Thank God for those shake-proof 
coffee mugs, Lisa.

144
00:13:48,786 --> 00:13:50,829
They show the true nature 
of us Californians.

145
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:53,958
We'll not bow to these inconvenient 
things like surface cracks.

146
00:13:55,417 --> 00:13:59,839
If you have a funny mini-quake story 
and wanna share it, call 555-1070...

147
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:09,431
- Hi, Daddy. 
- Hi, baby.

148
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:12,059
- How are you, sweetie? 
- Good.

149
00:14:12,226 --> 00:14:13,727
Jackson, what is this?

150
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:16,146
Please don't call me that. 
I'm your dad.

151
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:18,399
Come on.

152
00:14:18,566 --> 00:14:21,026
You're taking them camping 
in a limo?

153
00:14:21,443 --> 00:14:22,736
Okay, great.

154
00:14:22,903 --> 00:14:24,530
What happened to your temp job?

155
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:27,533
Oh, you know, better hours, 
more time to write.

156
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,452
What about sleeping? Have you 
been doing any of that lately?

157
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:35,749
I've said it a thousand times, no lipo 
on Fridays. It's too messy. Hold on.

158
00:14:35,916 --> 00:14:37,209
- Morning, Jackson. 
- Hi.

159
00:14:37,418 --> 00:14:38,586
- Nice ride. 
- Thanks.

160
00:14:38,752 --> 00:14:40,087
Guys, have a nice trip.

161
00:14:40,254 --> 00:14:42,923
Remember, watch out for the bears. 
You know, they're:

162
00:14:43,048 --> 00:14:44,300
Bye, Gordon.

163
00:14:44,466 --> 00:14:46,427
- Love you, honey. 
- Bye.

164
00:14:46,594 --> 00:14:48,679
- Okay, so, Lil... Oh, yeah. 
- You tell him.

165
00:14:49,471 --> 00:14:50,514
Tell me what?

166
00:14:50,681 --> 00:14:53,183
She needs to put these on 
before she goes to sleep.

167
00:14:53,183 --> 00:14:55,019
- I love you. 
- Love you, Mom.

168
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:57,521
- Hey. 
- You okay?

169
00:15:00,107 --> 00:15:02,109
They've been looking forward 
to spending time with you.

170
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,360
I know.

171
00:15:03,527 --> 00:15:06,405
- So don't be on your computer. 
- Got it.

172
00:15:10,284 --> 00:15:12,119
Love you.

173
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:19,209
- So this time, we hit Japan. 
- So?

174
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,086
Well, you could visit your boy, Will.

175
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,588
Afternoon, ladies.

176
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:24,256
- Hello there. 
- Hello, handsome.

177
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,799
Are you even listening to me?

178
00:15:25,966 --> 00:15:27,551
Unfortunately, I am, Harry.

179
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:29,595
I heard from Audrey 
you're a grandpa now.

180
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,222
Would you mind keeping your nose 
out of my family?

181
00:15:32,389 --> 00:15:35,309
You're cramping my style, baby. 
There we are.

182
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:38,938
So he married a Japanese girl. 
How is that the end of the world?

183
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:41,231
Come on, Tony. 
You should at least go see him.

184
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,109
- You see your boy? 
- Not as much as I'd like.

185
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:46,654
D.C. is a long way, 
but at least we talk.

186
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:48,155
About what?

187
00:15:48,322 --> 00:15:51,992
Life, and how short it is.

188
00:16:14,890 --> 00:16:17,977
What the hell was that?

189
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:20,080
Break it down.

190
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:26,837
- I liked that song. 
- We lost it.

191
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:30,799
...going on the West Coast 
with all those surface cracks.

192
00:17:30,966 --> 00:17:35,345
I told myself, "Charlie, 
get your stupid ass to Yellowstone. "

193
00:17:35,512 --> 00:17:39,183
I don't want to miss all the fun 
when it finally blows.

194
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,643
Let me tell you, 
there's been government people...

195
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:47,107
...flying in and out all morning, 
and trust me, they did not look happy.

196
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:49,610
- Always remember folks: 
- That's weird.

197
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,780
- You heard it first from Charlie. 
- Yeah, just when he said that?

198
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:55,532
What are the odds?

199
00:17:55,699 --> 00:17:57,951
We're not seeing soil liquefaction 
we'd expect...

200
00:17:58,118 --> 00:18:01,413
...or any evidence of fracture 
propagation within the tectonic plates.

201
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,624
- In English. 
- The activity on the coast...

202
00:18:03,791 --> 00:18:06,251
...is not caused by tecto... 
By regular earthquakes.

203
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:09,797
And these surface cracks have 
nothing to do with shifting fault lines.

204
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:13,175
You suggesting this could be the 
beginning of the Cho Ming operation?

205
00:18:13,342 --> 00:18:16,678
Dr. Helmsley is flying to Yellowstone 
this morning to collect more data.

206
00:18:16,845 --> 00:18:20,891
We have been following the schedule 
you established, Mr. Helmsley.

207
00:18:21,058 --> 00:18:23,560
The most important schedule 
in the history of mankind.

208
00:18:23,727 --> 00:18:25,479
Now you're telling me 
we have to throw it out?

209
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:28,190
Yes, sir.

210
00:18:29,525 --> 00:18:31,068
I was wrong.

211
00:18:34,696 --> 00:18:38,117
Do you know how many times 
I've heard those words in this office?

212
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,952
Zero.

213
00:18:41,829 --> 00:18:43,080
Daddy, where are we going?

214
00:18:44,164 --> 00:18:47,167
Going to this really special place 
that I know.

215
00:18:47,334 --> 00:18:50,170
It's a place where your mom and I 
used to hang out a lot.

216
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,631
I don't wanna know 
where you and Mom had sex.

217
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:55,384
- I'm not ready for that, Jackson. 
- Stop calling me that.

218
00:18:55,551 --> 00:18:58,720
It's creeping me out. 
What's wrong with "Dad"?

219
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:00,848
- Grumpy Grumperson. 
- Daddy, look at this.

220
00:19:02,182 --> 00:19:04,017
That wasn't here before.

221
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,311
What do we do?

222
00:19:06,687 --> 00:19:08,397
Go get your hat.

223
00:19:13,193 --> 00:19:15,070
Don't you see the signs?

224
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,788
Used to be a lake here.

225
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:27,124
Doesn't look much of a lake to me.

226
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:29,877
I know, 
the whole damn thing's gone.

227
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:34,298
- Come on, let's check it out. 
- Grwat.

228
00:19:56,570 --> 00:19:58,906
Subjects have now entered 
hot zone.

229
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,129
Who is that?

230
00:20:15,547 --> 00:20:16,840
That's the U.S. Army.

231
00:20:27,434 --> 00:20:31,063
All manner of government vehicle 
are converging on subjects.

232
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:32,814
You're in a restricted area, sir.

233
00:20:32,981 --> 00:20:35,651
- We need you to come with us. 
- Right. Right.

234
00:20:35,817 --> 00:20:37,069
Okay, we're gonna go 
with these guys.

235
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:39,154
That'll be fun, huh?

236
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,243
This is wild.

237
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:46,495
This is really wild.

238
00:20:57,798 --> 00:21:01,593
This is unbelievable. 
2700 degrees Celsius at 40,000 feet?

239
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,929
I know, 
it sounds completely implausible.

240
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:07,140
Nonetheless, we're ticking off 
an increase of almost 0.5 percent.

241
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,393
- Per day? 
- No.

242
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:10,602
Per hour.

243
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:13,772
Dr. Helmsley. We've arrested 
a group of tourists in the hot zone.

244
00:21:14,022 --> 00:21:15,315
Okay, I'll take care of it.

245
00:21:15,482 --> 00:21:18,110
Look, let's get Satnam 
on the communications link.

246
00:21:18,276 --> 00:21:20,237
We'll try and cross-reference 
the data.

247
00:21:20,404 --> 00:21:23,490
It's a national park. There's not 
supposed to be posted fences.

248
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:25,534
I mean, what's going on here?

249
00:21:25,701 --> 00:21:27,452
We're geologists.

250
00:21:28,161 --> 00:21:30,205
Do you usually go digging 
with machine guns?

251
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,042
Major, I'll take care of this. 
Thank you.

252
00:21:34,209 --> 00:21:37,379
- What happened to the lake? 
- That's what we're trying to find out.

253
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:39,631
We think the entire area 
has become unstable.

254
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:42,884
I think you should take your kids 
and leave, Mr. Curtis.

255
00:21:44,177 --> 00:21:46,555
You're not by any chance 
the Jackson Curtis...

256
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:49,099
...who wrote Farewell Atlantis, 
are you?

257
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:53,103
The very same.

258
00:21:54,229 --> 00:21:56,356
It's actually dedicated to my mom.

259
00:21:57,024 --> 00:21:58,525
That's great.

260
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:02,612
I read a couple of your short stories 
when I was in college. Yeah.

261
00:22:02,779 --> 00:22:05,449
You know, 
your father is a very talented man.

262
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:07,951
- Listen up. 
- It's amazing. I'm reading your book.

263
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:11,455
I'm around day 300, the shuttle has 
just lost communication with Earth.

264
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,540
You're one of the lucky few 
who bought it.

265
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:15,375
- I didn't buy it. 
- No?

266
00:22:15,584 --> 00:22:17,210
My dad gave it to me.

267
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,088
Let me ask you something.

268
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,800
You believe those people 
would behave so selflessly...

269
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:26,094
...knowing that their own lives 
were at stake?

270
00:22:26,261 --> 00:22:27,679
I hope so.

271
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:31,141
The critics said I was naive, 
an unabashed optimist...

272
00:22:31,308 --> 00:22:32,976
...but what do they know, right?

273
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,311
Well...

274
00:22:34,728 --> 00:22:36,980
- Pleasure. 
- It was a great pleasure meeting you.

275
00:22:37,564 --> 00:22:40,400
Major, could you escort these 
good people to the campgrounds?

276
00:22:40,567 --> 00:22:41,735
This is yours.

277
00:22:41,902 --> 00:22:43,236
- Thank you. 
- Yes, sir.

278
00:22:43,403 --> 00:22:44,404
- Take care. 
- Okay.

279
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:45,781
He was very nice.

280
00:22:45,947 --> 00:22:48,450
You're just saying that 
because he liked my book.

281
00:22:53,705 --> 00:22:57,417
Looks like that boy of yours 
is gonna be smarter than any of us.

282
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:03,090
What's wrong?

283
00:23:03,256 --> 00:23:05,967
I sent Satnam 
the temperature reading.

284
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:10,013
My colleagues in Argentina and 
Ontario have almost identical data.

285
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:12,599
It's so hot here, 
we've had to seal off the mine.

286
00:23:12,766 --> 00:23:15,435
- Double-checked the numbers? 
- Triple-checked, my friend.

287
00:23:15,602 --> 00:23:17,938
I wish we were wrong...

288
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,689
...but we're not.

289
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:22,776
The Earth's crust is destabilizing.

290
00:23:27,948 --> 00:23:29,241
It's too early.

291
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:32,911
Adrian, 
you have to begin the evacuation.

292
00:23:34,704 --> 00:23:36,289
My God.

293
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:40,252
All our scientific advances, 
our fancy machines...

294
00:23:40,418 --> 00:23:43,296
The Mayans saw this coming 
thousands of years ago.

295
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:54,683
I thought we'd have more time.

296
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,234
Okay.

297
00:24:04,693 --> 00:24:06,319
I want you to pack up your family.

298
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:09,114
I'm gonna arrange an airlift for you 
from Delhi.

299
00:24:09,281 --> 00:24:10,949
Thank you, my friend.

300
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,742
And good luck.

301
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:23,170
Ajit.

302
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,339
We are going on a big ship.

303
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,179
- That was so cool. 
- Yeah, that was intense.

304
00:24:32,345 --> 00:24:34,514
- The helicopters. 
- Craziest place I've seen.

305
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,351
- Those helicopters were so cool. 
- Wait. Wait. Wait.

306
00:24:38,518 --> 00:24:40,520
Wait. Sorry. One question:

307
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:45,942
What did the government guys 
say to you?

308
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:51,698
Well, they don't like us 
going over their fences...

309
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:55,869
...and that the whole area 
back there is unstable.

310
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:58,705
Unstable. They said "unstable"?

311
00:24:58,872 --> 00:24:59,956
Yeah, unstable.

312
00:25:02,292 --> 00:25:03,877
That's funny.

313
00:25:04,044 --> 00:25:06,296
Let's go. Have a good one.

314
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:11,134
Unstable.

315
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,933
It's not just Yellowstone, sir.

316
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:20,727
Temperatures are rising 
with incredible velocity...

317
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:22,479
...in hot zones across the globe.

318
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:24,940
Are you absolutely sure 
about this, Adrian?

319
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:26,775
Because once we give 
these orders...

320
00:25:26,942 --> 00:25:29,110
...there's no going back. 
You understand that?

321
00:25:29,277 --> 00:25:32,197
I'm afraid there's no longer 
any doubt, sir.

322
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,743
We have to save what we can. 
And we have to move now!

323
00:26:06,564 --> 00:26:09,859
There's mosquitoes in here. 
Did anybody spray the tent?

324
00:26:10,777 --> 00:26:12,445
I'm gonna get that spray tomorrow.

325
00:26:12,612 --> 00:26:15,615
They just like you 
because your blood's so sweet.

326
00:26:16,533 --> 00:26:19,202
Dad, you said you wouldn't work 
on your book.

327
00:26:19,369 --> 00:26:22,831
What, Lil'bee? I'm not, I'm not. 
I'm just... I'm doing something else.

328
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:26,293
Let me get you ready for... 
Ready for bed.

329
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:28,128
Okay.

330
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:32,632
Did you really need all these hats?

331
00:26:32,841 --> 00:26:35,552
- Where are your Pull-Ups, sweetie? 
- I have them on.

332
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:44,686
We have a listener calling in.

333
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:47,897
Bill from Cooke City, 
you're on the Charlie Frost Show.

334
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:50,108
Charlie, just wanted to say 
I love your show.

335
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:51,401
No way.

336
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,194
...not afraid to tell the truth.

337
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:55,196
Thank you, Bill. 
What is your question?

338
00:26:55,363 --> 00:26:57,574
I wanted to know, 
where is all this gonna start?

339
00:26:57,741 --> 00:27:01,077
Well, something like this could only 
originate in Hollywood, Bill.

340
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,788
They got the Earth 
cracking under their asses already.

341
00:27:03,955 --> 00:27:06,875
Our family believes in the gospel 
of the Lord Jesus.

342
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:10,629
- We have nothing to fear, Charlie. 
- Good for you, Bill. Thanks for calling.

343
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:15,592
This is Charlie Frost reporting live 
from Yellowstone National Park...

344
00:27:15,759 --> 00:27:20,847
...soon to become 
the world's largest active volcano.

345
00:27:21,348 --> 00:27:23,266
I'll be right back, folks.

346
00:27:26,436 --> 00:27:29,314
Do you mind if I join you? 
I wanted to ask you something.

347
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:31,024
I only got a minute.

348
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:33,026
Hey. Pickle?

349
00:27:33,401 --> 00:27:36,780
No. I was listening to the broadcast 
and I was wondering...

350
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:40,742
...what exactly is it 
that's gonna start in Hollywood?

351
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,786
It's the apocalypse.

352
00:27:42,952 --> 00:27:44,704
End of days.

353
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,416
The Judgment Day, 
the end of the world, my friend.

354
00:27:48,583 --> 00:27:52,045
Christians called it the rapture, 
but the Mayans knew about it...

355
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:55,465
...the Hopis, the I Ching...

356
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:57,300
...the Bible, kind of...

357
00:27:58,468 --> 00:27:59,511
Beer?

358
00:28:00,303 --> 00:28:02,680
- Yeah. 
- So look, I gotta eat.

359
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:06,685
Why don't you download my blog. 
It's free.

360
00:28:06,851 --> 00:28:10,146
Of course, 
we do appreciate donations.

361
00:28:10,313 --> 00:28:14,484
In ancient times, the Mayan people 
were the first civilization to discover...

362
00:28:14,693 --> 00:28:17,153
...that this planet had 
an expiration date.

363
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,822
According to their calendar...

364
00:28:18,988 --> 00:28:22,492
...in the year 2012, 
a cataclysmic event will unfold...

365
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,537
...caused by an alignment 
of the planets in our solar system...

366
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,833
...that only happens 
every 640,000 years.

367
00:28:29,082 --> 00:28:31,668
Oh, not again.

368
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,588
Pretty neat, huh? 
I did all the animation myself.

369
00:28:36,131 --> 00:28:39,008
Just imagine the Earth 
as an orange.

370
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:43,888
You lure them in with humor. 
Then you make them think.

371
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,726
Our sun will begin to emit 
such extreme amounts of radiation...

372
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:50,103
Those little bastards 
are called neutrinos.

373
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:53,940
...that the core of the Earth will melt. 
That's the inside part of the orange...

374
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:57,277
...leaving the crust of our planet 
free to shift.

375
00:28:57,444 --> 00:29:02,198
In 1958, Professor Charles Hapgood 
named it Earth Crust Displacement.

376
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:05,368
Albert Einstein did support it.

377
00:29:05,535 --> 00:29:06,703
People, we'll get it all.

378
00:29:06,870 --> 00:29:09,747
The forces of Mother Nature 
will be so devastating...

379
00:29:09,914 --> 00:29:15,795
...it will bring an end to this world 
on winter solstice, 12-21-12.

380
00:29:15,962 --> 00:29:20,049
Always remember, folks, 
you heard it first from Charlie Frost.

381
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,553
You'd have to keep a thing like this 
under wraps.

382
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:25,805
I mean, just think about it, okay?

383
00:29:25,972 --> 00:29:28,558
First, the stock market would go.

384
00:29:28,766 --> 00:29:31,019
Then the economy, boom!

385
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:32,479
The dollar, boom!

386
00:29:32,645 --> 00:29:37,734
And then pandemonium in the streets. 
War, genocide, boom, boom, boom!

387
00:29:38,318 --> 00:29:41,488
Bullshit. Nobody could keep 
that big a secret, Charlie.

388
00:29:41,654 --> 00:29:44,407
- Somebody would blow the whistle. 
- Every once in a while...

389
00:29:44,574 --> 00:29:46,576
...some poor little sucker tries.

390
00:29:46,784 --> 00:29:49,496
Well, like these guys, boom, boom!

391
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:53,333
Every one of these guys, 
dead, dead, dead.

392
00:29:56,836 --> 00:29:58,338
That's Professor Meyers.

393
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:01,341
He ran the Atlantis shuttle program. 
Why, did you know him?

394
00:30:01,508 --> 00:30:03,927
Yeah, he helped me 
with research on my book.

395
00:30:04,093 --> 00:30:06,679
Well, that must have been 
before his "accident. "

396
00:30:06,846 --> 00:30:07,972
Meyers is dead?

397
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,892
Oh, yeah, two months ago.

398
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:13,812
He was one 
of my most avid listeners...

399
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,939
...and he had it all figured out.

400
00:30:16,105 --> 00:30:19,442
Everything the government was doing, 
where and why...

401
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,820
He even sent me a map.

402
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:25,907
A map for what, Charlie? 
What's the map for?

403
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:36,626
They're building spaceships, man.

404
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,467
Shit, man, I have to go...

405
00:30:44,634 --> 00:30:47,929
...because I gotta get back to Earth.

406
00:30:48,096 --> 00:30:50,807
- But do you got a traveler for the road? 
- This is my last...

407
00:30:50,974 --> 00:30:54,143
Oh, that'll be all right. But, anyway, 
I really enjoyed most of this.

408
00:30:54,310 --> 00:30:55,478
Thank you so much.

409
00:30:55,645 --> 00:30:57,480
Hey. Hey, guess what.

410
00:30:57,647 --> 00:31:00,358
- They're selling seats. 
- Put me down for three.

411
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:01,776
No, guys like you and me 
don't have a chance.

412
00:31:02,819 --> 00:31:05,280
You'd have to be Bill Gates 
or Rupert Murdoch...

413
00:31:05,446 --> 00:31:07,448
...or some Russian billionaire 
or something.

414
00:31:07,615 --> 00:31:09,325
Keep it down, my kids are sleeping.

415
00:31:09,492 --> 00:31:12,245
Get them out of Yellowstone.

416
00:31:12,412 --> 00:31:14,581
It's gonna get ugly here.

417
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,126
Do you have anything 
for mosquito bites?

418
00:31:18,293 --> 00:31:20,128
Before or after?

419
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:23,047
I'd get before and after.

420
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:25,967
Stop scratching. 
You're gonna get it all infected.

421
00:31:26,134 --> 00:31:28,303
I had to make a stop 
at the grocery store.

422
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:31,347
It's Mrs. Birnbaum. 
She's my teacher, she's on TV.

423
00:31:32,390 --> 00:31:35,560
Here is Grayson's Market, which 
was open for business at the time...

424
00:31:35,727 --> 00:31:39,147
...but fortunately, there were 
no fatalities or injuries reported.

425
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:41,482
It really is a miracle 
that no one got hurt.

426
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:44,027
Hello? Oh, hi, Mom.

427
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:48,072
Did you see what happened 
to our supermarket?

428
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,493
She wants us to come home.

429
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,828
is this even possible?

430
00:31:53,995 --> 00:31:56,164
We worked every option 
through the night.

431
00:31:56,331 --> 00:32:00,501
The good news, consensus is that four 
of the arks will be operational in time.

432
00:32:00,668 --> 00:32:02,337
Only four? You call that good news?

433
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:05,006
We can save over 400,000 people.

434
00:32:05,173 --> 00:32:07,258
To me, sir, 
that's nothing short of a miracle.

435
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:11,179
But we have to initiate 
the boarding process now. Thomas.

436
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,348
We don't have a choice.

437
00:32:13,514 --> 00:32:15,391
You have got to convince them.

438
00:32:18,061 --> 00:32:19,812
Listen, I'll try to keep this brief.

439
00:32:19,979 --> 00:32:23,024
According to the latest information 
from Yellowsto...

440
00:32:23,191 --> 00:32:26,194
- Please continue, Adrian. 
- Thank you, sir.

441
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,738
The temperature 
of the subterranean crust...

442
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:32,659
...that is, the cement that holds 
our land mass in place...

443
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:36,120
...is increasing at a rapid rate, 
much faster than anticipated.

444
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:39,374
As a result, we've observed 
extreme polar instability.

445
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,335
The magnetic fields have decreased 
by more than 80 percent...

446
00:32:42,502 --> 00:32:44,045
...in the last 48 hours.

447
00:32:44,212 --> 00:32:47,382
How much time do we have, 
Dr. Helmsley?

448
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:51,386
Two, maybe three days, 
if we're lucky.

449
00:32:52,220 --> 00:32:55,890
How can you speak about luck 
in such a situation?

450
00:32:56,057 --> 00:32:58,810
Apologies, Mr. Prime Minister. I...

451
00:32:58,976 --> 00:33:01,938
I meant no disrespect.

452
00:33:02,563 --> 00:33:07,110
I'm afraid the longer we wait, 
the more luck plays its part.

453
00:33:12,907 --> 00:33:14,242
My friends...

454
00:33:15,576 --> 00:33:17,995
...I recommend 
we evacuate immediately.

455
00:33:20,373 --> 00:33:23,292
If any of you have objections...

456
00:33:24,460 --> 00:33:26,004
...please speak now.

457
00:33:27,004 --> 00:33:28,589
In the blue corner...

458
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:32,218
...38 victories, 34 knockouts...

459
00:33:32,385 --> 00:33:35,263
...the fighting machine 
from the Ukraine...

460
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:39,809
...the undefeated number-one ranked 
heavyweight challenger:

461
00:33:39,976 --> 00:33:46,649
Mr. Zultan Balashin!

462
00:34:07,628 --> 00:34:10,465
Kill the bastard, Zultan.

463
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:13,009
Ladies and gentlemen...

464
00:34:13,176 --> 00:34:17,138
...let's get ready to rumble!

465
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,310
Zultan!

466
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:03,184
One, two, three...

467
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:07,563
Caltech believes that the half-mile 
fissure running through Westwood...

468
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,816
...has released 
most of the surface tension.

469
00:35:09,982 --> 00:35:12,860
"Life will soon return to normal," 
Mayor Gonzales said...

470
00:35:13,027 --> 00:35:16,364
- ... at an early news conference. 
- Okay, guys. Almost home.

471
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,534
Rise and shine.

472
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:32,171
All right, you're free.

473
00:35:33,673 --> 00:35:36,384
- Thank God. 
- Mommy.

474
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,554
Hi, sweetheart.

475
00:35:43,516 --> 00:35:44,934
Gordon!

476
00:35:46,144 --> 00:35:48,187
Hey, buddy boy.

477
00:35:49,105 --> 00:35:51,399
Good time? Yeah?

478
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:53,234
God, I missed you.

479
00:35:53,401 --> 00:35:54,402
Yeah.

480
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,946
- Who wants pancakes? Come on. 
- Me.

481
00:36:01,242 --> 00:36:04,620
- Thanks for bringing them home early. 
- Yeah.

482
00:36:05,580 --> 00:36:07,081
Pancakes?

483
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,251
Late for work.

484
00:36:21,137 --> 00:36:23,848
- Yes, hello? 
- Curtis, where are you?

485
00:36:24,015 --> 00:36:27,602
- Just getting back from vacation, sir. 
- Good. That is good.

486
00:36:27,768 --> 00:36:30,146
I will send the jet 
to pick up Alec and Oleg.

487
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:33,274
Yuri bear, tell him to bring 
the raincoat for Caesar.

488
00:36:33,441 --> 00:36:35,776
- It's in the Range Rover. 
- Curtis.

489
00:36:35,943 --> 00:36:38,112
- Yeah? 
- Get my boys as fast as you can.

490
00:36:38,279 --> 00:36:40,281
I'm hurtling towards you 
as we speak, sir.

491
00:36:40,448 --> 00:36:41,657
Good. That is good.

492
00:36:57,131 --> 00:36:58,466
Curtis, you're late.

493
00:36:58,633 --> 00:37:00,509
Good morning to you too.

494
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:07,808
Oh, be careful with our stuff. 
Don't get your dirt on it.

495
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:09,727
Idiot.

496
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:18,236
Took you a while, Mr. Curtis.

497
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:22,949
What's your problem?

498
00:37:23,991 --> 00:37:25,326
Be more careful.

499
00:37:25,493 --> 00:37:27,036
He did that on purpose.

500
00:37:27,203 --> 00:37:29,497
Hey, have a safe trip, 
you little bastards.

501
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:31,832
Now you're laughing, Curtis...

502
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:34,001
...but we have tickets 
to go on a big ship.

503
00:37:34,168 --> 00:37:35,753
We will live...

504
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,047
...and you will die.

505
00:37:49,642 --> 00:37:51,519
Folks, did you hear that?

506
00:37:51,686 --> 00:37:56,107
The authorities in L.A. 
say there's nothing to worry about.

507
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:58,734
I'd love to see their dumb faces...

508
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,362
...when Malibu and Beverly Hills...

509
00:38:01,529 --> 00:38:05,157
...get sucked into the gurgling maw 
of the Pacific.

510
00:38:05,324 --> 00:38:08,369
Where they gonna plug in 
their electric cars then?

511
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:14,250
- Hey. is this your plane? 
- Yes.

512
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,876
- Are you a pilot? 
- Yeah.

513
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,920
I wanna rent it. 
I'll give you anything.

514
00:38:18,087 --> 00:38:19,839
Here. 
This is a very expensive watch.

515
00:38:20,006 --> 00:38:23,217
My editor gave it to me when 
he thought I was gonna be somebody.

516
00:38:25,428 --> 00:38:26,846
Hello?

517
00:38:26,971 --> 00:38:28,514
- Stop what you're doing. 
- Jackson?

518
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:31,308
Listen to me. I've rented a plane. 
Pack up the kids.

519
00:38:31,475 --> 00:38:34,145
- I'm gonna be there in five minutes. 
- Plane? What?

520
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:37,815
We're gonna do our regular Saturday. 
Noah has music and Lil has karate.

521
00:38:37,982 --> 00:38:39,650
Not that we'd expect him 
to remember.

522
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,944
Kate, California is going down. 


523
00:38:42,111 --> 00:38:44,989
Okay, could you call me back 
when you calm down?

524
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:47,366
Mommy? Why is daddy so crazy?

525
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:51,245
Mommy!

526
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,341
Everyone hold on to each other.

527
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,469
- No, Lilly! 
- Hold Mommy's hand and stay close.

528
00:39:08,804 --> 00:39:09,889
Daddy!

529
00:39:10,056 --> 00:39:11,348
Let's go! Let's go!

530
00:39:11,515 --> 00:39:13,350
I think it's safer under here!

531
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:17,480
Get in the fucking car right now!

532
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:19,148
Move your ass! Move!

533
00:39:19,315 --> 00:39:20,608
- Come on, kids. 
- Get up!

534
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:22,485
- Move. Quick, quick! 
- Move!

535
00:39:23,110 --> 00:39:25,321
Go! Now!

536
00:39:26,322 --> 00:39:28,657
- Come on, let's go. 
- Run! Don't look back!

537
00:39:28,824 --> 00:39:30,993
- Come on! 
- Take her! Get in, honey, get in.

538
00:39:32,453 --> 00:39:33,954
My hats.

539
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:37,208
Lilly, get in!

540
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,335
Get in!

541
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,754
- Buckle up! 
- Lilly.

542
00:39:49,804 --> 00:39:51,180
Sorry.

543
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:06,570
Jackson, hurry up. Look behind you.

544
00:40:08,072 --> 00:40:09,949
- Holy...! 
- Oh, God.

545
00:40:14,703 --> 00:40:16,455
Get out of herw! 
Get out of the way!

546
00:40:16,622 --> 00:40:19,208
- Move it! 
- Hold on to those eggs, dear.

547
00:40:19,375 --> 00:40:21,377
- Come on! 
- Come on, you old bags!

548
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,214
Sidewalk, sidewalk! Tree! Tree!

549
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:29,385
God. Carwful.

550
00:40:32,888 --> 00:40:34,265
Everybody, hang on.

551
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:38,978
Oh, my God.

552
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:40,604
Careful, careful.

553
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,402
Yikes. That stinks.

554
00:40:52,491 --> 00:40:54,326
We gotta get to the airport.

555
00:40:54,493 --> 00:40:56,787
Well, take the freeway, 
it'll be half the time.

556
00:40:59,915 --> 00:41:01,500
Yeah, right.

557
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,258
Jesus.

558
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,262
We gotta get to the other side 
of the freeway.

559
00:41:14,263 --> 00:41:15,890
Daddy!

560
00:41:27,693 --> 00:41:30,696
- Dad, look! 
- No. We're not gonna make it! Careful!

561
00:41:38,954 --> 00:41:40,956
- No, Daddy! 
- Dad, look. Dad, look.

562
00:41:42,625 --> 00:41:43,876
No, no, no!

563
00:41:56,805 --> 00:41:59,308
It's been upgraded to a 10.9 
by the guys at Harvard.

564
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,976
What does Caltech have to say?

565
00:42:01,143 --> 00:42:05,314
The whole city of Pasadena 
was wiped out just a few minutes ago.

566
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,442
This is coming in from Coachella 
Valley out near Joshua Tree.

567
00:42:08,609 --> 00:42:10,736
That canyon? 
That wasn't there this morning.

568
00:42:10,903 --> 00:42:14,907
And 400 miles further north, 
Point Reyes, same thing.

569
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:18,452
The San Andreas Fault is shifting.

570
00:42:18,619 --> 00:42:21,330
Yes. And all major sister faults 
in the Bay Area.

571
00:42:20,955 --> 00:42:25,334
The whole Pacific plate 
is destabilizing.

572
00:42:31,507 --> 00:42:33,384
Hold my hand. Stay close to me.

573
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:36,011
Come on!

574
00:42:36,178 --> 00:42:38,055
- Who's that? 
- Our pilot!

575
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,849
Oh, jeez. It's our pilot.

576
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,935
Gordon. Gordon, you can fly.

577
00:42:43,102 --> 00:42:46,564
No, no, I've only had a couple of 
lessons in a single-engine plane only.

578
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:48,357
- You're the guy. 
- I am not the guy.

579
00:42:48,524 --> 00:42:52,403
- Trust me, you're the guy. 
- I'm not being modest about this.

580
00:42:52,569 --> 00:42:54,863
Come on, kids. 
Gordon's gonna get us out of here.

581
00:42:55,030 --> 00:42:57,199
That plane has multiple engines.

582
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:00,202
Jackson!

583
00:43:15,259 --> 00:43:17,052
- T's and P's, T's and P's. 
- T and P?

584
00:43:17,219 --> 00:43:18,887
- Temperatures and pressures. 
- Go!

585
00:43:19,054 --> 00:43:21,640
- I've gotta do my preflight check. 
- Let him concentrate.

586
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,142
He has no experience.

587
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:24,727
Thank you.

588
00:43:26,228 --> 00:43:27,730
- Gordon, go. 
- Come on.

589
00:43:27,896 --> 00:43:29,940
- Gordon! 
- Go, go, go!

590
00:43:32,401 --> 00:43:34,820
- We're not there yet. 
- Gordon, take off.

591
00:43:35,904 --> 00:43:38,115
- Punch it, punch it! 
- I have to get to 85 knots.

592
00:43:38,282 --> 00:43:40,909
- Eighty's good. 
- Oh, screw it. Here we go.

593
00:43:45,789 --> 00:43:47,791
Okay. Okay, we're up.

594
00:43:56,967 --> 00:43:58,677
Higher, higher!

595
00:44:35,506 --> 00:44:37,299
Oh, my God.

596
00:45:04,576 --> 00:45:06,495
Lilly, go sit with your brother.

597
00:45:11,333 --> 00:45:14,169
I don't understand. How did you know 
this was gonna happen?

598
00:45:14,837 --> 00:45:16,880
It is not just California.

599
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,758
It's the whole goddamn world 
that's going to shit.

600
00:45:19,925 --> 00:45:22,052
I met this guy in Yellowstone, 
this crazy guy.

601
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,888
He's been right about everything 
that's happened so far.

602
00:45:25,055 --> 00:45:27,349
And he said the government 
is building spaceships.

603
00:45:27,516 --> 00:45:29,685
- I don't know what, but something. 
- Ships?

604
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:31,687
Yeah, places where we can be safe.

605
00:45:32,146 --> 00:45:34,690
He knows where they are. 
He's got a map.

606
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:36,191
Jackson.

607
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:38,485
Kate, you gotta just trust me on this, 
okay?

608
00:45:38,652 --> 00:45:41,196
Guys, look.

609
00:46:03,844 --> 00:46:07,055
There's a twist and a turn 
To each lesson you learn

610
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:10,559
First you're up, then you're bust 
Livin' life on a crust

611
00:46:10,726 --> 00:46:13,896
But it ain't the end of the world, buddy

612
00:46:14,062 --> 00:46:16,899
It's only the end of this song

613
00:46:17,065 --> 00:46:20,486
It's been a gas, been a flip 
Been a hell of a trip

614
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:25,574
But it ain't the end of the world

615
00:46:26,783 --> 00:46:28,243
Oh, yeah.

616
00:46:28,410 --> 00:46:29,495
Thank you.

617
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:30,913
You got fans, Tony.

618
00:46:33,081 --> 00:46:35,667
There's a call for you. 
You want me to take a message?

619
00:46:35,834 --> 00:46:37,878
No, that's all right, Kevin. I got it.

620
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,260
- Hello. 
- Dad?

621
00:46:45,427 --> 00:46:46,762
Adrian.

622
00:46:46,929 --> 00:46:50,516
Remember when I told you 
about that dam in China?

623
00:46:50,682 --> 00:46:51,975
Yeah.

624
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:53,936
It's happening, Dad.

625
00:47:02,778 --> 00:47:06,990
They'd probably shoot me 
if they knew that I told you.

626
00:47:08,075 --> 00:47:11,286
Nobody's gonna shoot you, son. 
They need you.

627
00:47:11,453 --> 00:47:15,082
The president has ordered us 
to clear out the White House.

628
00:47:15,249 --> 00:47:17,793
About time somebody cleaned up 
that mess.

629
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:22,381
Where are you, Dad?

630
00:47:22,923 --> 00:47:26,093
What exactly is the course 
of the Genesis right now?

631
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:28,637
It's all good, Adrian.

632
00:47:28,804 --> 00:47:31,807
Don't you be worrying 
about your old man now.

633
00:47:31,974 --> 00:47:34,977
You got more important things 
to do now.

634
00:47:37,354 --> 00:47:38,981
You know...

635
00:47:39,857 --> 00:47:41,817
...your mom and I, we...

636
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:45,195
We had one hell of a great life, son.

637
00:47:46,989 --> 00:47:50,450
And the best part about that...

638
00:47:51,493 --> 00:47:54,329
...is we had 
one hell of a great kid too.

639
00:47:57,499 --> 00:47:59,001
Now, you lookie here.

640
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:01,044
The Genesis...

641
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:03,672
...it's a pretty big ship, son.

642
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:08,343
So don't you write your old man off 
just yet.

643
00:48:08,510 --> 00:48:09,511
Besides...

644
00:48:11,305 --> 00:48:14,266
...you know I couldn't leave 
Tony alone.

645
00:48:14,433 --> 00:48:18,937
You know that old fool 
can't keep decent time by himself.

646
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:23,025
I love you, Dad.

647
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,490
I love you too, son.

648
00:48:30,657 --> 00:48:32,784
God knows I do.

649
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,133
Kevin, I want a double.

650
00:48:48,842 --> 00:48:52,512
- Harry. 
- I need a double right now.

651
00:48:56,642 --> 00:48:58,226
Thank you, son.

652
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:05,776
After 25 years on the wagon, 
are you out of your mind?

653
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,251
- What are you doing? 
- Gotta go.

654
00:49:23,418 --> 00:49:26,421
- That's against regulation. 
- Careful, careful.

655
00:49:30,759 --> 00:49:32,260
- Anything? 
- Yeah, there's fuel.

656
00:49:32,427 --> 00:49:34,179
Fill it up. I'm gonna find Charlie.

657
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,014
Daddy, wait. I wanna come with you.

658
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:39,101
- No, no. Lil. Lil, no! 
- It's all right. Just fill it up.

659
00:49:39,267 --> 00:49:41,269
- We'll be back. 
- Jackson, hurry, please.

660
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:44,773
I'm standing here 
at the highest point...

661
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:49,903
...of what is the rim of the world's 
largest super-volcano...

662
00:49:50,070 --> 00:49:55,993
- ... Mount Bighorn, elevation 2779 feet. 
- Charlie! Charlie! Charlie!

663
00:49:56,952 --> 00:50:01,373
I can only hope that all of you 
have made your peace with God...

664
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:03,875
- He's gotta be around somewhere. 
- Let's go back.

665
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:06,712
No, no, no. We gotta find Charlie 
because he's got a map.

666
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:09,172
It's like a secret map, 
like in the Pirate movies.

667
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:11,133
- We gotta work as a team, okay? 
- Okay.

668
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:12,968
Okay, come on.

669
00:50:13,135 --> 00:50:15,971
Call Mommy and tell her 
we're gonna be 5 minutes late.

670
00:50:20,809 --> 00:50:22,811
- Hello? 
- I need to talk to Mommy.

671
00:50:22,978 --> 00:50:25,147
- It's Lilly. 
- Sweetheart, where are you?

672
00:50:25,313 --> 00:50:27,858
- Hi, Mommy. 
- Let me speak to Daddy, sweetie.

673
00:50:28,024 --> 00:50:31,069
He can't talk right now. 
He's driving really, really bad.

674
00:50:33,071 --> 00:50:35,699
Any minute now, 
the fireworks are gonna start.

675
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,659
Who is that? 
Who's speaking in the car?

676
00:50:37,826 --> 00:50:40,871
He's not in the car. He's on 
a mountain waiting for fireworks.

677
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:44,166
- Fireworks? What fireworks? 
- Daddy. Daddy, over there.

678
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:46,877
...to send all of Yellowstone 
into outer space?

679
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:48,336
Good job, Lilly. Good job.

680
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:52,007
Let me talk to Mom.

681
00:50:52,174 --> 00:50:55,427
- Kate, we got him. 
- Jackson, bring back my child now.

682
00:50:58,847 --> 00:51:01,850
Okay. You stay here 
and guard the ship...

683
00:51:02,017 --> 00:51:04,728
- ... and I'm gonna go talk to the pirate. 
- Okay.

684
00:51:04,895 --> 00:51:07,564
...your race, your country, your god.

685
00:51:07,731 --> 00:51:12,444
Whether you're a Christian or 
a Buddhist or Muslim or Rastafarian...

686
00:51:12,611 --> 00:51:15,864
- ... by tomorrow we will all be one! 
- Charlie.

687
00:51:16,031 --> 00:51:17,908
- Jackson. What are you doing here? 
- Yeah.

688
00:51:18,075 --> 00:51:20,911
- I thought you were toast. 
- No. Where are the spaceships?

689
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:23,205
There's no way 
you can make it there.

690
00:51:23,371 --> 00:51:27,417
We have a plane. You could come 
with us, but we gotta leave right now.

691
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,886
Fly, birdies.

692
00:51:38,053 --> 00:51:39,888
Fly!

693
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:41,640
is this your kid?

694
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:43,809
Where's the goddamn map?

695
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:45,894
- We're going live. 
- Where is it?

696
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,814
Charlie. Focus. Where's the map? 
Where?

697
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:50,065
It's in the camper.

698
00:51:50,232 --> 00:51:51,274
Where in the camper?

699
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:54,778
In the map section 
on the conspiracy shelf.

700
00:51:54,945 --> 00:51:56,863
Dewey decimal system.

701
00:51:57,030 --> 00:51:59,449
Between Roswell...

702
00:51:59,616 --> 00:52:02,744
...and Marilyn Monroe.

703
00:52:11,086 --> 00:52:13,129
It's starting.

704
00:52:21,096 --> 00:52:23,598
You sure you don't wanna come with, 
man?

705
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:27,227
It's so beautiful. I'm gonna stay.

706
00:52:28,145 --> 00:52:29,729
Good luck.

707
00:52:32,941 --> 00:52:38,446
This marks the last day 
of the United States of America.

708
00:52:39,781 --> 00:52:43,118
And, by tomorrow, all of mankind.

709
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:45,787
And we will be visible 
from the Milky Way...

710
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:48,665
...as a tiny little puff of smoke.

711
00:52:49,291 --> 00:52:52,961
I'm watching the earth crumble 
before my eyes.

712
00:52:54,796 --> 00:53:00,385
The giant ash cloud 
created by this super-volcano...

713
00:53:00,552 --> 00:53:02,637
...will first envelop Vegas...

714
00:53:03,138 --> 00:53:04,639
...and then St. Louis...

715
00:53:05,307 --> 00:53:07,309
...and then Chicago...

716
00:53:07,475 --> 00:53:09,519
...and then, at long last...

717
00:53:09,686 --> 00:53:14,149
...Washington, D.C. 
will have its lights go out!

718
00:53:14,316 --> 00:53:17,319
- That guy's crazy, right, Daddy? 
- I don't think so.

719
00:53:20,196 --> 00:53:21,656
This is ridiculous.

720
00:53:21,823 --> 00:53:24,409
Been over half an hour. 
I tell you, the guy's a nut job.

721
00:53:24,576 --> 00:53:26,161
Stop it, Gordon.

722
00:53:26,328 --> 00:53:28,246
Noah, hand me the phone again.

723
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,395
Daddy, what was that?

724
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,857
Nothing. Nothing.

725
00:53:56,316 --> 00:53:59,194
I have goose bumps, people.

726
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,261
I wish you could see 
what I'm seeing, people.

727
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,972
I wish you could be here with me!

728
00:54:27,681 --> 00:54:30,058
Oh, baby.

729
00:54:31,059 --> 00:54:33,061
Bring it on!

730
00:54:33,228 --> 00:54:34,896
Always remember, folks...

731
00:54:35,730 --> 00:54:38,942
...you heard it first from Charlie!

732
00:54:54,874 --> 00:54:56,251
Daddy, it's following us.

733
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:57,919
Don't look! Get on the ground.

734
00:54:58,086 --> 00:55:00,255
Get on the ground and hold on. 
Don't look back.

735
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:03,466
Don't look back. Just look at me. 
Look at me. Do I look scared?

736
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:10,807
Now, hold on, baby. Hold on tight.

737
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,607
Daddy, we're on fire.

738
00:55:28,283 --> 00:55:30,118
There it is! There they are.

739
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:36,833
It's them.

740
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:39,044
It's them. It's them.

741
00:55:40,462 --> 00:55:41,546
Mommy!

742
00:55:45,216 --> 00:55:46,634
Jeez.

743
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:55,643
- No, Daddy. 
- Hang on, baby. Hang on!

744
00:55:58,688 --> 00:55:59,856
No, Daddy!

745
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:10,325
Oh, my Go...

746
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:13,203
- Mommy. 
- Take her, take her. I'll be right back.

747
00:56:19,834 --> 00:56:22,879
- Come here, Lil. Grab my hand. 
- Come on, Lil. Lilly, you okay?

748
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,381
Aliens, Roswell 
and Marilyn Monroe...

749
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,092
Maps! Maps!

750
00:56:27,550 --> 00:56:30,428
- Everybody on? Are we ready? 
- Jackson!

751
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:36,518
- Kate, where is he? What's he doing? 
- I don't know.

752
00:56:39,687 --> 00:56:41,272
No!

753
00:56:49,614 --> 00:56:51,449
- Daddy! 
- No!

754
00:56:54,702 --> 00:56:57,872
- Oh, my God. 
- Kate, we have to go.

755
00:56:58,039 --> 00:56:59,624
No. We're not going anywhere.

756
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:03,670
- Kids, buckle up, we're leaving. 
- This is my dad. We're gonna wait.

757
00:57:08,550 --> 00:57:10,301
No!

758
00:57:10,468 --> 00:57:12,053
Daddy!

759
00:57:15,557 --> 00:57:18,476
Wait! 
Wait, Gordon, I see something.

760
00:57:18,643 --> 00:57:20,228
Dad!

761
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,984
It's Daddy!

762
00:57:30,405 --> 00:57:31,739
Slow down!

763
00:57:31,906 --> 00:57:32,907
Jackson, run!

764
00:57:33,908 --> 00:57:36,411
Jackson, take my hand. Jackson.

765
00:57:36,578 --> 00:57:38,788
- Dad, hurry! 
- Run!

766
00:57:39,664 --> 00:57:42,750
We're running out of runway. 
For God's sakes, Kate, pull him up.

767
00:57:42,917 --> 00:57:46,462
- Jackson, reach for my hand. 
- Dad, you can make it, come on.

768
00:57:46,629 --> 00:57:48,298
Daddy!

769
00:57:52,427 --> 00:57:54,429
All right, buckle in. Here we go!

770
00:57:55,513 --> 00:57:57,182
Come on, faster. Faster.

771
00:58:17,118 --> 00:58:18,661
Hang on.

772
00:58:20,079 --> 00:58:22,832
- Go faster. 
- I'm trying.

773
00:58:39,641 --> 00:58:41,643
Okay. We're good!

774
00:58:41,809 --> 00:58:44,646
- We're good. 
- We're okay.

775
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:51,152
So now that you got your map, 
where are we going?

776
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:04,582
We're gonna need a bigger plane.

777
00:59:11,965 --> 00:59:14,509
No, you just said that, Mom. 
Yeah, you just said that.

778
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,678
You don't remember 
that you just said that?

779
00:59:16,844 --> 00:59:20,056
That's okay. That's okay.

780
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:24,352
Listen, Ma, I am going to call you 
next week, same time.

781
00:59:24,852 --> 00:59:26,104
Okay?

782
00:59:26,271 --> 00:59:28,523
You take care now. 
Take care of yourself.

783
00:59:32,026 --> 00:59:33,611
Sir?

784
00:59:34,445 --> 00:59:36,531
I think you need to see this.

785
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,911
The South American continent 
has been ravaged...

786
00:59:42,078 --> 00:59:43,788
...by a series of major earthquakes.

787
00:59:43,955 --> 00:59:47,041
The death toll is expected 
to be well over 2 million people.

788
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:50,461
The devastation in Rio de Janeiro 
is beyond imagination.

789
00:59:50,628 --> 00:59:53,631
Two 8.5 tremors have left 
the people in the streets...

790
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:56,426
...desperately fighting 
for the last remaining resources.

791
00:59:56,593 --> 01:00:00,888
In the last hour, we received this video from Globo News, Brazil.

792
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:10,481
Fear and chaos have spread 
throughout the globe, as in London...

793
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:13,484
...where the 30th Olympic Games 
have just been suspended.

794
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:16,571
Hundreds of thousands are marching 
towards 10 Downing Street...

795
01:00:16,738 --> 01:00:19,532
...demanding a lift 
of the information blackout.

796
01:00:19,699 --> 01:00:22,285
We've had thousands of calls. 
We had to shut it down.

797
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:25,038
We're receiving reports 
from all across the globe.

798
01:00:25,204 --> 01:00:27,457
Millions upon millions 
of distraught masses...

799
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,835
...are gathering in public places, 
converging in desperate prayer.

800
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,087
Preachers of many 
religious denominations...

801
01:00:33,254 --> 01:00:35,173
...have taken their message 
of the end...

802
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:36,966
...to the strwets all over the U.S.

803
01:00:37,133 --> 01:00:38,801
Repent. There is still time.

804
01:00:42,513 --> 01:00:44,057
Mr. President.

805
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:47,143
I need to get you on Air Force One 
immediately.

806
01:00:48,936 --> 01:00:50,271
Give me a moment with Adrian.

807
01:00:50,438 --> 01:00:52,565
No disrespect, 
but we simply do not have time.

808
01:00:52,732 --> 01:00:54,150
Make time.

809
01:01:06,746 --> 01:01:09,707
Did you ever meet my wife, 
Dorothy?

810
01:01:09,874 --> 01:01:13,086
No, sir. I didn't have that honor.

811
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,964
She was in and out of it 
towards the end.

812
01:01:17,799 --> 01:01:21,803
The night before she passed on, 
she took my hand and she told me:

813
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:25,640
"I think you should have a lottery.

814
01:01:26,641 --> 01:01:30,269
Everyone should 
have a chance to go. "

815
01:01:32,939 --> 01:01:34,774
Maybe that's what 
we should have done.

816
01:01:38,444 --> 01:01:42,907
I'll be the last president 
of the United States of America.

817
01:01:43,074 --> 01:01:45,118
Do you know how that feels, son?

818
01:01:46,285 --> 01:01:49,163
No one could have 
saved the country, sir.

819
01:01:50,498 --> 01:01:51,958
And I think...

820
01:01:52,625 --> 01:01:55,128
I think people have a right to know.

821
01:01:55,962 --> 01:01:58,631
Don't worry, I'll take care of that.

822
01:02:00,466 --> 01:02:01,843
Go on now.

823
01:02:03,636 --> 01:02:05,471
Not without you, sir.

824
01:02:06,222 --> 01:02:08,641
You get on that plane, son.

825
01:02:09,976 --> 01:02:13,187
It's a brave new world 
you're heading to.

826
01:02:13,354 --> 01:02:18,568
And a young scientist 
is gonna be worth 20 old politicians.

827
01:02:44,510 --> 01:02:47,013
You, be careful 
with the landing gear.

828
01:02:47,180 --> 01:02:49,515
Easy, gringo. I know what I doing.

829
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:52,185
Attention. The National Guard 
has informed us...

830
01:02:52,351 --> 01:02:54,312
...that an extremely hazardous 
ash cloud...

831
01:02:54,479 --> 01:02:55,897
...is headed for Las Vegas.

832
01:02:56,063 --> 01:02:57,356
Hey, where are you going?

833
01:02:57,523 --> 01:03:00,026
Everyone move indoors 
immediately.

834
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:02,403
- Sir, you can't stay here. 
- I have plane here.

835
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:03,779
It's not safe. Move it!

836
01:03:04,739 --> 01:03:05,781
Move it!

837
01:03:10,912 --> 01:03:13,122
My fellow Americans...

838
01:03:13,831 --> 01:03:17,168
...this will be the last time 
I address you.

839
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:19,212
As you know...

840
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:23,216
...catastrophe has struck 
our nation...

841
01:03:24,383 --> 01:03:26,511
...has struck the world.

842
01:03:26,677 --> 01:03:28,513
I wish I could tell you...

843
01:03:29,055 --> 01:03:32,183
...we could prevent 
the coming destruction.

844
01:03:32,642 --> 01:03:34,268
We cannot.

845
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:37,396
Today, none of us are strangers.

846
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:40,024
Today...

847
01:03:40,191 --> 01:03:45,404
...we are one family 
stepping into the darkness together.

848
01:03:45,571 --> 01:03:48,783
We are a nation of many religions...

849
01:03:48,074 --> 01:03:55,122
...but I believe these words 
reflect the spirit of all of our faiths:

850
01:03:55,957 --> 01:03:59,085
The Lord is my shepherd, I shall...

851
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:03,714
People! Keep away 
from the doors and windows.

852
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,050
What are we gonna do? 
Where are we gonna go?

853
01:04:06,217 --> 01:04:07,426
Dr. Silberman.

854
01:04:08,636 --> 01:04:10,638
- Tamara. 
- What are you doing here?

855
01:04:10,805 --> 01:04:13,474
- Excuse me. 
- She's a patient, honey.

856
01:04:13,641 --> 01:04:16,435
Excuse me, 
I have a private plane out there.

857
01:04:16,602 --> 01:04:17,895
- Karpov! 
- We need help.

858
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,480
- Yuri! 
- Takeoffs are canceled.

859
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:22,275
- Curtis, you're... 
- You knew. This whole time you knew.

860
01:04:22,441 --> 01:04:25,319
So you've got a way out of here, right? 
You got a plane?

861
01:04:25,486 --> 01:04:27,613
My family, take us with. 
Please. Please.

862
01:04:27,780 --> 01:04:29,574
Boss. Boss.

863
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:31,701
I found us a plane, an Antonov.

864
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:34,579
They were about to take off, 
but the tower didn't let them.

865
01:04:34,745 --> 01:04:36,080
But can you still fly that thing?

866
01:04:37,164 --> 01:04:39,959
Sure, boss. But I need copilot.

867
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:43,087
Gordon's a pilot.

868
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,673
No, I'm not. I'm not.

869
01:04:45,840 --> 01:04:47,842
Yes, he is. Great pilot. Let's go.

870
01:04:49,260 --> 01:04:50,428
Good. Let's go!

871
01:04:50,595 --> 01:04:53,347
Honey, this is... 
Jackson, stop saying I'm a pilot.

872
01:04:53,514 --> 01:04:55,850
Hey! Hey, stop!

873
01:04:56,058 --> 01:04:58,436
You can't go out there. Come back!

874
01:05:03,691 --> 01:05:05,276
Move back, people.

875
01:05:05,484 --> 01:05:06,068
Get away from the glass!

876
01:05:11,616 --> 01:05:13,618
Wow, that's a big plane.

877
01:05:14,785 --> 01:05:16,621
It's Russian.

878
01:05:17,288 --> 01:05:19,123
- Let's move, everybody. Come on. 
- Run!

879
01:05:19,290 --> 01:05:21,626
- Yeah, let's go, let's go. 
- Boys, come on.

880
01:05:24,795 --> 01:05:26,714
- Gordon, where are you? 
- Where did you go?

881
01:05:26,881 --> 01:05:29,842
I'm up here in the cockpit. 
Hurry up.

882
01:05:30,593 --> 01:05:32,637
Oh, my God. Not again.

883
01:05:40,645 --> 01:05:42,104
Whoa, look at these.

884
01:05:42,271 --> 01:05:44,649
Las Vegas Auto Show.

885
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:46,984
We had VIP tickets for that.

886
01:05:47,401 --> 01:05:48,861
That's fantastic. Let's go.

887
01:05:49,028 --> 01:05:51,030
Check the main bus for hydraulics, 
I'll balance the tanks.

888
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:53,449
What?

889
01:05:55,034 --> 01:05:57,703
Okay, okay, okay. I'm trying, okay? 
I'm trying.

890
01:06:06,420 --> 01:06:07,755
Caesar.

891
01:06:07,922 --> 01:06:11,175
Okay, when I say go, 
you push all this down at once, okay?

892
01:06:11,342 --> 01:06:12,426
- Okay. 
- Go!

893
01:06:17,306 --> 01:06:20,476
- What the hell was that? 
- I don't know, but it's not good.

894
01:06:23,396 --> 01:06:24,689
- Push. 
- Pushing.

895
01:06:24,855 --> 01:06:26,399
Come on!

896
01:06:29,986 --> 01:06:32,238
We're going down! 
We're going down!

897
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:41,163
Where are the flaps? 
The flaps are not down.

898
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:43,290
It must be the pumps. Take over.

899
01:06:43,457 --> 01:06:46,043
Take over? 
What do you mean, take over?

900
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,505
- Sasha! 
- Relax!

901
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:50,715
Sit down!

902
01:06:55,094 --> 01:06:57,555
God. God. Jesus.

903
01:07:00,433 --> 01:07:02,017
- Oh, God. 
- Okay, I think I got it.

904
01:07:02,184 --> 01:07:04,937
- Sasha, now! 
- Okay, okay. Take a deep breath.

905
01:07:05,855 --> 01:07:07,356
Pull!

906
01:07:08,941 --> 01:07:12,028
Come on, baby. 
Lift your big ass for Sasha!

907
01:07:15,948 --> 01:07:18,534
- Pull! Pull! 
- Come on.

908
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:31,881
Mommy.

909
01:07:34,049 --> 01:07:35,885
Was that the Eiffel Tower?

910
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,053
I think so.

911
01:07:45,853 --> 01:07:47,313
Ladies and gentlemen...

912
01:07:47,897 --> 01:07:50,483
...we are on our way to China.

913
01:07:52,109 --> 01:07:55,446
Good. That is good, huh?

914
01:10:17,922 --> 01:10:19,298
Hey, look. The new Bentley.

915
01:10:19,465 --> 01:10:21,467
Our father had one on order.

916
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,719
We were supposed 
to get it next year.

917
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:26,388
But then he canceled it 
because of the ships.

918
01:10:27,389 --> 01:10:30,142
How many cars 
does your family have?

919
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,311
My mom's boyfriend 
has a Porsche.

920
01:10:33,854 --> 01:10:34,730
Our parents are divorced too.

921
01:10:35,814 --> 01:10:38,192
Yeah, but there's nothing 
we can do about that.

922
01:10:38,359 --> 01:10:40,152
Found a hat.

923
01:10:40,319 --> 01:10:41,570
She has a thing for hats.

924
01:10:42,363 --> 01:10:44,698
I was just like that at her age.

925
01:10:44,865 --> 01:10:46,533
They made me feel safe.

926
01:10:47,785 --> 01:10:50,704
So how did you meet Dr. Silberman?

927
01:10:52,039 --> 01:10:54,833
As you can see, 
not the same way you did.

928
01:10:56,085 --> 01:11:00,047
My boyfriend asked me 
to get them done.

929
01:11:00,214 --> 01:11:01,465
He's not your husband?

930
01:11:01,632 --> 01:11:06,095
Oh, no. We are not married. 
And probably never will.

931
01:11:13,852 --> 01:11:15,604
For the boys.

932
01:11:20,234 --> 01:11:22,361
They seem to like each other, huh?

933
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,405
She is adorable.

934
01:11:24,571 --> 01:11:26,615
Yeah, I guess.

935
01:11:27,908 --> 01:11:30,995
So tell me, Mr. Karpov, 
how much did you pay?

936
01:11:31,578 --> 01:11:35,708
One billion euro. Per seat.

937
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,837
- That's disgusting. 
- Oh, yeah?

938
01:11:40,713 --> 01:11:44,466
You know, Curtis, 
I wasn't always businessman.

939
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:46,844
I am a boxer.

940
01:11:47,011 --> 01:11:50,639
Was my only playing 
when I was boy back in Murmansk.

941
01:11:50,848 --> 01:11:55,227
And my coach, 
his name was also Yuri.

942
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,937
He always said:

943
01:11:57,604 --> 01:12:03,902
"If someone wants to beat you, 
he has to kill you first. "

944
01:12:06,947 --> 01:12:08,532
That's very nice.

945
01:12:08,699 --> 01:12:09,825
Yeah.

946
01:12:10,117 --> 01:12:15,706
But tell me, what would you have done 
if you rich like me?

947
01:12:15,873 --> 01:12:19,752
Look. 
They are wonderful children, huh?

948
01:12:21,086 --> 01:12:22,504
Okay, guys.

949
01:12:22,671 --> 01:12:25,591
The plan is to refuel in Hawaii, 
so sit down and buckle up.

950
01:12:26,258 --> 01:12:28,469
Gordon and I will do the rwst.

951
01:12:31,138 --> 01:12:31,305
Oh, God.

952
01:12:34,475 --> 01:12:35,809
Go get the guys.

953
01:12:39,355 --> 01:12:41,857
Guys, there's a... 
You might wanna...

954
01:13:00,834 --> 01:13:02,711
What is that?

955
01:13:02,294 --> 01:13:05,005
The state of Hawaii.

956
01:13:05,547 --> 01:13:09,426
Not good. That is not good.

957
01:13:14,515 --> 01:13:16,266
How much fuel do we have left?

958
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:19,686
Not enough. We're going to 
have to make a water landing...

959
01:13:19,853 --> 01:13:21,855
...somewherw in South China Sea.

960
01:13:22,022 --> 01:13:24,608
Great. At least we're not gonna need 
the landing gear.

961
01:13:24,775 --> 01:13:27,903
- What about it? 
- Oh, we lost it all. in Vegas.

962
01:13:50,217 --> 01:13:53,429
Hello. I'm sorry. Who is this?

963
01:13:53,595 --> 01:13:57,391
This is Yoko Delgatto. 
Do you wanna speak to my daddy?

964
01:14:00,894 --> 01:14:02,396
Yes, please.

965
01:14:02,563 --> 01:14:04,815
Who should I say is calling?

966
01:14:08,152 --> 01:14:10,946
Tell him it's his father.

967
01:14:11,113 --> 01:14:12,990
You're my grandpa?

968
01:14:14,074 --> 01:14:16,410
Yes, sweetheart, I am.

969
01:14:18,287 --> 01:14:21,206
Daddy, Daddy, 
Grandpa's on the phone.

970
01:15:24,394 --> 01:15:25,479
Mr. President, sir.

971
01:15:29,441 --> 01:15:31,985
Mr. President.

972
01:15:33,487 --> 01:15:36,240
- What's the matter, sweetie? 
- She can't find her daddy.

973
01:15:38,951 --> 01:15:40,911
Why don't you two 
get comfy on that couch?

974
01:15:41,078 --> 01:15:43,872
Sally, come help them out, okay?

975
01:15:45,165 --> 01:15:47,167
I'll find your daddy.

976
01:15:54,925 --> 01:15:56,593
Who can help me 
with missing persons?

977
01:15:56,760 --> 01:15:59,304
Sorry, man. 
I'm really busy right now.

978
01:16:00,514 --> 01:16:03,433
I mean... Of course, sir. 
Sorry, Mr. President.

979
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:06,395
Don't worry about it. 
You're doing a great job, son.

980
01:16:32,629 --> 01:16:34,965
- What? 
- The capital's been hit by a 9.4.

981
01:16:35,132 --> 01:16:36,466
We've lost communication.

982
01:16:36,633 --> 01:16:39,678
- Where's it centered? 
- North Chesapeake Bay.

983
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:47,060
Mr. Anheuser, the Russian president's 
on the line, sir.

984
01:16:47,227 --> 01:16:48,270
Excuse me.

985
01:16:49,187 --> 01:16:51,648
We just entered Chinese airspace.

986
01:16:52,941 --> 01:16:54,818
That's affirmative, Mr. President.

987
01:16:54,985 --> 01:16:59,698
Until communication is restored, 
I suppose I am in command.

988
01:17:00,657 --> 01:17:03,243
it appears that all other 
heads of state are en route...

989
01:17:03,410 --> 01:17:06,038
...with the exception 
of the Italian prime minister...

990
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:11,084
...who has also decided 
to stay behind and trust in prayer.

991
01:18:18,276 --> 01:18:20,612
The Earth's crust has begun to shift, 
Dr. Helmsley.

992
01:18:20,779 --> 01:18:23,990
- By what degree? 
-1.2 degrees, but it's still moving.

993
01:18:24,157 --> 01:18:25,450
So, what happens next?

994
01:18:25,617 --> 01:18:28,120
Once the movement 
of our land masses comes to a halt...

995
01:18:28,286 --> 01:18:30,080
Let's see a simulation, Scotty.

996
01:18:30,247 --> 01:18:32,499
...expect the formation 
of gigantic tsunamis...

997
01:18:32,666 --> 01:18:35,961
...proportional to the magnitude 
of the corresponding quakes.

998
01:18:53,603 --> 01:18:55,147
From what we have just learned...

999
01:18:54,396 --> 01:18:58,358
...Tokyo seems to have taken 
the full force of the earthquake.

1000
01:18:58,525 --> 01:19:00,777
At this point, 
unconfirmed reports indicate...

1001
01:19:00,944 --> 01:19:03,864
...that large areas of land 
are underwater.

1002
01:19:04,030 --> 01:19:06,199
Please stay tuned for further...

1003
01:19:15,917 --> 01:19:17,586
Tony...

1004
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:19,713
I called.

1005
01:19:23,300 --> 01:19:25,093
I was too late.

1006
01:19:29,514 --> 01:19:32,809
Maybe they got out in time.

1007
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:34,978
You never know. They...

1008
01:20:03,256 --> 01:20:04,633
Harry!

1009
01:21:02,232 --> 01:21:04,901
I'm coming home, Dorothy.

1010
01:21:31,303 --> 01:21:32,762
Anything?

1011
01:21:34,180 --> 01:21:37,726
Nothing. Just static. 
Not even an emergency signal.

1012
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,158
Can't think about 
what's going on down there.

1013
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:02,584
Remember that old Beetle 
we used to camp in?

1014
01:22:02,751 --> 01:22:04,628
We could never get the roof up.

1015
01:22:04,794 --> 01:22:06,379
Yeah.

1016
01:22:06,546 --> 01:22:08,465
We definitely traded up.

1017
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:13,428
Tried to find our old spot 
at Yellowstone...

1018
01:22:13,845 --> 01:22:15,805
...when I went camping 
with the kids...

1019
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:18,725
...but I couldn't find it.

1020
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:34,324
All global ground communication 
has ceased, sir.

1021
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:40,372
The only signals our satellites 
are picking up...

1022
01:22:40,538 --> 01:22:42,916
...are coming from the vessels 
in Cho Ming.

1023
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:45,669
Well, there's a piece of good news.

1024
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:47,087
Any updates, doctor?

1025
01:22:47,253 --> 01:22:50,423
We expect the tsunamis 
to reach landfall in every continent.

1026
01:22:50,590 --> 01:22:54,094
The Cho Ming area will be impacted 
in approximately six hours.

1027
01:22:55,845 --> 01:22:58,890
it looks like the crust has shifted 
by almost 23 degrees...

1028
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:00,850
...to the southwest.

1029
01:23:01,059 --> 01:23:05,939
The data also shows the Earth's poles 
have reversed their magnetic fields.

1030
01:23:06,106 --> 01:23:07,524
These are their new positions.

1031
01:23:08,441 --> 01:23:09,943
So you're...

1032
01:23:10,735 --> 01:23:13,154
You're telling me 
that the North Pole...

1033
01:23:13,697 --> 01:23:15,949
...is now somewhere in Wisconsin?

1034
01:23:16,116 --> 01:23:18,451
Actually, that's the South Pole now.

1035
01:23:27,210 --> 01:23:29,504
Engine failure. 
Two of the six are down.

1036
01:23:29,671 --> 01:23:31,589
We must get ready.

1037
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:36,553
- How long do we have? 
- Fifteen minutes. Maybe.

1038
01:23:38,054 --> 01:23:41,016
- Better wake up the kids. 
- Yeah.

1039
01:24:11,755 --> 01:24:13,381
is it time?

1040
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:19,387
- Dad, what's wrong? 
- Well, Sasha said we gotta land...

1041
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:23,266
...and it's gonna be a little bumpy 
and maybe a little wet.

1042
01:24:23,433 --> 01:24:24,476
Daddy?

1043
01:24:30,857 --> 01:24:32,067
Hold her steady.

1044
01:24:50,168 --> 01:24:52,462
Daddy, 
I'm not a really good swimmer.

1045
01:24:51,711 --> 01:24:56,716
Hey, no, that's all right. 
That's what you got this for. Right?

1046
01:24:56,883 --> 01:24:59,969
it's like being in a swimming pool, 
only it's got more cool stuff.

1047
01:25:00,136 --> 01:25:03,389
Look, it's got a whistle, 
and a light thing. Right?

1048
01:25:03,556 --> 01:25:05,683
I thought we were going to China.

1049
01:25:06,684 --> 01:25:08,770
No, we gotta land here.

1050
01:25:11,773 --> 01:25:14,025
So we're just all gonna 
stay together, right?

1051
01:25:14,192 --> 01:25:17,153
- No, we're not, we're gonna die. 
- No. We're not.

1052
01:25:17,862 --> 01:25:19,322
Promise?

1053
01:25:19,489 --> 01:25:21,574
I promise you 
we're gonna all stay together...

1054
01:25:21,741 --> 01:25:25,370
...no matter what happens, okay?

1055
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,009
Jackson.

1056
01:25:40,552 --> 01:25:41,886
Yuri.

1057
01:25:43,054 --> 01:25:44,848
I think you better come up here.

1058
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:47,016
I'm gonna go check this out.

1059
01:25:47,183 --> 01:25:49,185
- Dad. Where are you going? 
- I'll be back.

1060
01:25:49,352 --> 01:25:52,272
- You said you'd stay with us. 
- We gotta buckle up. Let's go.

1061
01:25:53,565 --> 01:25:55,775
Okay, don't ask me 
how that happened...

1062
01:25:55,942 --> 01:25:57,402
...but there is no more ocean...

1063
01:25:57,569 --> 01:25:59,612
...and we're close 
to where we wanted to go.

1064
01:25:59,779 --> 01:26:01,990
it's like the world shifted 
by 1000 miles.

1065
01:26:02,156 --> 01:26:04,742
One thousand five hundrwd 
and seventy-eight to be exact.

1066
01:26:04,909 --> 01:26:07,287
it's called 
Earth Crust Displacement Theory.

1067
01:26:07,495 --> 01:26:09,581
Professor Hapgood, 1958.

1068
01:26:10,456 --> 01:26:11,499
Way to go, Charlie.

1069
01:26:15,587 --> 01:26:16,921
What was that?

1070
01:26:17,922 --> 01:26:20,133
We just lost our last two engines.

1071
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:42,030
I'm gonna shoot for that glacier. 
it's gonna get rocky.

1072
01:26:42,196 --> 01:26:46,451
Listen, this is gonna sound crazy, 
but here's what you have to do.

1073
01:26:50,079 --> 01:26:52,248
Unbuckle. 
Come on, come on, come on.

1074
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:55,668
Yuri! What are we doing?

1075
01:26:55,835 --> 01:26:58,338
We are taking the Bentley.

1076
01:26:59,923 --> 01:27:02,467
Not yet. Not yet.

1077
01:27:02,634 --> 01:27:04,177
it has to be perfect.

1078
01:27:04,344 --> 01:27:05,929
Almost there.

1079
01:27:06,095 --> 01:27:08,640
- Come on. 
- Get in the car.

1080
01:27:18,650 --> 01:27:21,402
Okay, go. Now. Pull.

1081
01:27:26,324 --> 01:27:28,826
No, no, no!

1082
01:27:31,829 --> 01:27:33,248
Go. Go, Jackson.

1083
01:27:33,414 --> 01:27:35,917
No, we gotta wait 
for Sasha and Gordon.

1084
01:27:36,084 --> 01:27:39,712
Go. Make sure everybody gets out 
of the plane before I touch down.

1085
01:27:39,879 --> 01:27:40,922
What about you?

1086
01:27:41,089 --> 01:27:45,593
I'll be fine. 
I have to touch this baby down.

1087
01:27:45,677 --> 01:27:47,595
Go!

1088
01:28:02,026 --> 01:28:03,403
There he is. I see him.

1089
01:28:02,652 --> 01:28:06,155
- Wherw is Sasha? Wherw is Sasha? 
- Come on. Let's go.

1090
01:28:06,322 --> 01:28:09,450
He said he's fine. We should get 
out of here before he touches down.

1091
01:28:09,617 --> 01:28:11,786
No, no, no. Don't go. 
We have to wait for him.

1092
01:28:12,328 --> 01:28:14,247
Go, Jackson. Go.

1093
01:28:14,414 --> 01:28:18,084
- Don't go! 
- it won't start. it won't start.

1094
01:28:18,251 --> 01:28:21,754
Just shut up, everybody!

1095
01:28:21,838 --> 01:28:22,880
...start.

1096
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:28,720
Voice control. Sold me on it.

1097
01:30:08,528 --> 01:30:11,197
Hey! Hey!

1098
01:30:32,093 --> 01:30:34,303
Welcome to 
the People's Republic of China.

1099
01:30:34,887 --> 01:30:37,056
Good to be here. Say hi, kids.

1100
01:30:37,223 --> 01:30:38,307
- Hi. 
- Hi.

1101
01:30:38,474 --> 01:30:40,101
What color are your passes?

1102
01:30:41,769 --> 01:30:44,313
What color 
are your boarding passes?

1103
01:30:46,023 --> 01:30:47,191
I have green card.

1104
01:30:48,401 --> 01:30:50,278
For my boys and me.

1105
01:30:50,445 --> 01:30:51,946
What?

1106
01:30:55,366 --> 01:30:57,535
Yuri. Yuri.

1107
01:30:57,702 --> 01:31:01,080
Yuri, it's a mistake. A joke, right?

1108
01:31:01,247 --> 01:31:02,748
What?

1109
01:31:03,082 --> 01:31:06,460
You think I didn't know 
about you and Sasha?

1110
01:31:08,212 --> 01:31:11,257
May God bless 
that poor bastard's soul.

1111
01:31:16,888 --> 01:31:19,724
I'm sorry, guys. Good luck.

1112
01:31:21,142 --> 01:31:22,894
Come on, boys.

1113
01:31:24,520 --> 01:31:26,564
- Does anybody have any money? 
- I do, I do.

1114
01:31:26,731 --> 01:31:28,191
You got a billion euros?

1115
01:31:33,196 --> 01:31:34,238
Dr. Wilson?

1116
01:31:35,156 --> 01:31:37,742
I'm Captain Michaels, 
skipper of the American ship.

1117
01:31:37,909 --> 01:31:40,161
Please accept my condolences 
for your father.

1118
01:31:40,328 --> 01:31:42,079
Thank you, captain.

1119
01:31:43,456 --> 01:31:46,209
Mr. Anheuser, 
your party is the last to arrive.

1120
01:31:50,463 --> 01:31:52,798
There've been reports 
of severe damage, captain.

1121
01:31:52,965 --> 01:31:54,842
What's the status of Ark Number 3?

1122
01:31:55,009 --> 01:31:57,345
We haven't done 
a complete assessment yet...

1123
01:31:57,512 --> 01:31:59,805
...but it looks like we lost it.

1124
01:32:54,026 --> 01:32:55,861
Leave it to the Chinese.

1125
01:32:56,028 --> 01:32:57,863
I didn't think it was possible.

1126
01:32:58,030 --> 01:32:59,699
Not in the time we had.

1127
01:33:00,283 --> 01:33:01,742
That's Ark Number 3, sir.

1128
01:33:02,660 --> 01:33:05,955
The roof collapsed on it 
during the shifting of the Earth's crust.

1129
01:33:06,872 --> 01:33:08,374
Jesus Christ.

1130
01:33:09,584 --> 01:33:13,045
Boarding of Ark Number 3 will be 
delayed due to technical difficulties.

1131
01:33:13,212 --> 01:33:14,714
- Excuse me. 
- We paid a fortune!

1132
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,883
Please be patient 
as we keep you updated.

1133
01:33:19,093 --> 01:33:21,262
What he said about you and Sasha, 
is it true?

1134
01:33:21,429 --> 01:33:25,182
Sasha was worth 
100 times a man like Yuri.

1135
01:33:25,182 --> 01:33:27,768
I should have listened to you, 
Dr. Silberman.

1136
01:33:27,935 --> 01:33:32,898
I actually liked the way I looked 
before that monster talked me into it.

1137
01:33:33,566 --> 01:33:35,151
You hear that?

1138
01:33:37,903 --> 01:33:39,780
Over there !

1139
01:33:41,324 --> 01:33:42,867
- Hey! 
- Hey!

1140
01:33:43,034 --> 01:33:45,244
- Stop! Stop! Please! 
- Hey! Hold it!

1141
01:33:49,248 --> 01:33:51,000
Hey! Hey!

1142
01:33:51,500 --> 01:33:54,253
Stop! Stop! Stop!

1143
01:33:55,546 --> 01:33:57,173
Help!

1144
01:34:06,515 --> 01:34:07,642
Hey!

1145
01:35:00,152 --> 01:35:01,487
Satnam, where are you?

1146
01:35:01,654 --> 01:35:04,448
- On the Nampan Plateau. 
- What?

1147
01:35:05,658 --> 01:35:07,118
There's a tidal wave 
coming from the east.

1148
01:35:07,284 --> 01:35:11,330
- it's gigantic. 
- Satnam, what happened?

1149
01:35:11,497 --> 01:35:13,624
We never got picked up, Adrian.

1150
01:35:13,791 --> 01:35:16,001
The airlift never came.

1151
01:35:17,503 --> 01:35:19,255
Goodbye, my friend.

1152
01:35:19,880 --> 01:35:25,803
Satnam.

1153
01:35:45,740 --> 01:35:48,659
- The flooding is coming this way? 
- Mary. Where are we set up?

1154
01:35:48,826 --> 01:35:50,286
Over therw.

1155
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:56,041
Get me the satellite images 
from Nampan, India.

1156
01:35:55,291 --> 01:35:57,918
- Okay, right away. 
- What's happening?

1157
01:35:59,211 --> 01:36:01,839
No. Satnam was talking 
about another wave...

1158
01:36:02,006 --> 01:36:02,631
...coming from the east.

1159
01:36:07,094 --> 01:36:09,555
- Holy mother. 
- The flooding is gonna hit earlier?

1160
01:36:09,722 --> 01:36:12,433
is that what you're telling me? 
The second wave is closer?

1161
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:14,560
- Plug in the new data. 
- Okay.

1162
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,731
When's it gonna get here? Talk to me, 
Helmsley. When's it gonna hit?

1163
01:36:19,815 --> 01:36:21,484
Adjust the countdown.

1164
01:36:37,625 --> 01:36:40,503
Twenty-eight minutes, 
10 seconds to impact.

1165
01:36:40,669 --> 01:36:41,921
Oh, my God.

1166
01:36:42,087 --> 01:36:45,549
Captain, I need to speak to the other 
heads of state immediately.

1167
01:36:45,716 --> 01:36:48,511
- Right away. Taylor? 
- Aye, captain. Standing by.

1168
01:36:48,677 --> 01:36:51,263
Ark 6, stand by. Ark 7, stand by.

1169
01:36:51,430 --> 01:36:54,099
- Carl Anheuser, acting CIC, Ark 4. 
- Yes, sir.

1170
01:36:54,266 --> 01:36:56,560
Requesting emergency conference, 
T-99.

1171
01:37:32,888 --> 01:37:35,724
Attention: All construction workers, 
off deck.

1172
01:37:36,141 --> 01:37:39,019
All crew members, onboard now.

1173
01:37:39,186 --> 01:37:40,938
They're opening the mountain.

1174
01:37:41,397 --> 01:37:44,149
They are leaving without us.

1175
01:37:44,316 --> 01:37:47,611
Step back. Get back. 
What did I tell you?

1176
01:37:47,778 --> 01:37:50,698
They are leaving you behind too. 
Look, idiot.

1177
01:37:50,865 --> 01:37:52,950
Please be patient.

1178
01:37:55,578 --> 01:37:57,079
Let's go.

1179
01:38:00,124 --> 01:38:06,797
Follow me.

1180
01:38:19,059 --> 01:38:21,061
initiate security procedures.

1181
01:38:21,228 --> 01:38:25,858
Time to impact: 
17 minutes, 42 seconds.

1182
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:37,828
Green lights on pressure, 
Mr. Anton?

1183
01:38:37,995 --> 01:38:40,039
Green lights across the board, 
captain.

1184
01:38:51,800 --> 01:38:53,177
Why do they have anchors?

1185
01:38:53,344 --> 01:38:56,639
Because they're not spaceships, 
buddy. They're arks.

1186
01:38:56,805 --> 01:38:58,390
Let's go.

1187
01:39:43,394 --> 01:39:44,436
Stop.

1188
01:39:44,603 --> 01:39:46,230
Stop! Stop!

1189
01:39:47,648 --> 01:39:48,691
Stop!

1190
01:39:55,280 --> 01:39:56,782
Engage the support mechanisms.

1191
01:39:56,949 --> 01:39:59,159
Aye, aye, captain. 
Engaging bow-anchor supports.

1192
01:39:59,326 --> 01:40:02,121
How long are these things expecting 
to hold us in place?

1193
01:40:02,287 --> 01:40:05,249
They're just meant to withstand 
the first impact of the waves.

1194
01:40:31,817 --> 01:40:51,044
Caesar.

1195
01:40:53,881 --> 01:40:55,340
Good. Good boy.

1196
01:40:55,799 --> 01:40:57,968
Come to Mommy. Caesar!

1197
01:40:59,261 --> 01:41:01,138
Mom, where's Tamara?

1198
01:41:03,432 --> 01:41:04,683
Daddy look!

1199
01:41:06,101 --> 01:41:08,187
Come on. Caesar, come on.

1200
01:41:08,353 --> 01:41:10,063
- Tamara! 
- I'm coming.

1201
01:41:18,030 --> 01:41:19,656
Take him.

1202
01:41:50,145 --> 01:41:51,522
The people of Russia...

1203
01:41:53,732 --> 01:41:54,900
...along with China...

1204
01:41:57,152 --> 01:42:00,155
...and Japan, agree.

1205
01:42:01,198 --> 01:42:03,116
Open the gates.

1206
01:42:05,160 --> 01:42:09,206
The United Kingdom, 
Spain, France, Canada, Germany...

1207
01:42:09,373 --> 01:42:13,836
...and I believe I may also speak 
for the Italian prime minister...

1208
01:42:14,002 --> 01:42:16,755
...we vote to let these people 
come in.

1209
01:42:22,845 --> 01:42:24,513
Captain Michaels.

1210
01:42:26,056 --> 01:42:27,224
Please.

1211
01:42:31,144 --> 01:42:32,688
This is the captain.

1212
01:42:32,855 --> 01:42:35,440
in a few moments, 
we will open the gates...

1213
01:42:35,607 --> 01:42:37,401
...and get you people in.

1214
01:42:37,568 --> 01:42:41,113
Please step back 
and clear the platform.

1215
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:45,909
P- yew, it stinks.

1216
01:43:04,845 --> 01:43:07,222
- They are opening the gates. 
- Go. Go.

1217
01:43:07,389 --> 01:43:09,725
Climb! Don't look down! Climb! Go!

1218
01:43:15,564 --> 01:43:16,899
What's wrong with the gate?

1219
01:43:17,065 --> 01:43:20,068
Looks like it didn't run the full cycle. 
We're checking, captain.

1220
01:43:20,777 --> 01:43:21,862
Hold it.

1221
01:43:22,863 --> 01:43:23,906
Hold it, people.

1222
01:43:28,493 --> 01:43:31,038
Four minutes to impact.

1223
01:44:14,957 --> 01:44:16,500
Go to the lower deck. Let's go.

1224
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,503
- We are loaded, captain. 
- Well, then let's lock it up. Now.

1225
01:44:35,644 --> 01:44:39,231
Captain, 
Cho Ming Airfield's been hit.

1226
01:44:39,398 --> 01:44:41,149
Put me on emergency com, 
Mr. Taylor.

1227
01:44:41,316 --> 01:44:43,652
Aye. You're on, captain.

1228
01:44:43,819 --> 01:44:45,237
This is the captain speaking.

1229
01:44:46,321 --> 01:44:49,074
We expect to be impacted 
by water shortly.

1230
01:45:02,462 --> 01:45:05,340
All stations, prepare for impact.

1231
01:45:44,921 --> 01:45:47,174
Collision pressure 
just below 80 pascal, captain.

1232
01:45:47,340 --> 01:45:49,885
0.2 mil surface compression 
on bow sensors, captain.

1233
01:45:50,010 --> 01:45:51,845
track Dr. Helmsley

1234
01:45:53,180 --> 01:45:54,222
Professor...

1235
01:45:55,057 --> 01:45:56,892
...it's Air Force One.

1236
01:46:14,493 --> 01:46:16,995
- The mid-ship anchor is hit. 
- We're destabilizing.

1237
01:46:17,162 --> 01:46:18,455
The bow anchor's giving in.

1238
01:46:53,657 --> 01:46:55,200
impact warning.

1239
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:57,244
Thirty degrees west.

1240
01:46:57,410 --> 01:46:59,162
Forty-five degrees east.

1241
01:46:59,329 --> 01:47:02,207
Target elevation, 29,035 feet.

1242
01:47:02,290 --> 01:47:04,543
We're headed straight 
for the north face...

1243
01:47:04,709 --> 01:47:06,878
...of Mount Everest, Mr. Anheuser.

1244
01:47:07,045 --> 01:47:11,633
And if we can't start our engines, 
we will not survive the impact.

1245
01:47:20,809 --> 01:47:24,771
Distance to impact: 1850 meters.

1246
01:47:37,242 --> 01:47:40,120
Distance to impact: 400 meters.

1247
01:47:40,287 --> 01:47:43,123
Underwater ridge ahead. 
We're going to run aground, captain.

1248
01:47:46,751 --> 01:47:49,337
- Sir, the gate is sealed. 
- That's affirmative, captain.

1249
01:47:49,504 --> 01:47:51,381
Anton, start the engine.

1250
01:47:51,548 --> 01:47:53,300
Aye, aye, captain. Full reverse.

1251
01:48:02,225 --> 01:48:06,438
- Too fast! We're not gonna make it. 
- Distance to impact: 50 meters.

1252
01:48:07,105 --> 01:48:08,356
Forty meters.

1253
01:48:32,047 --> 01:48:34,174
Reverse motion activated.

1254
01:48:34,341 --> 01:48:37,802
Distance to impact: 10 meters.

1255
01:48:38,428 --> 01:48:39,596
Twenty meters.

1256
01:48:48,188 --> 01:48:49,522
Yes!

1257
01:48:54,402 --> 01:48:56,696
- Hard to port. 
- Aye, captain. Hard to port.

1258
01:49:25,642 --> 01:49:27,060
The end. "

1259
01:49:25,684 --> 01:49:27,811
Ladies and gentlemen, 
this is Captain Michaels speaking.

1260
01:49:28,895 --> 01:49:32,190
in a few minutes I will give orders 
to unseal the decks.

1261
01:49:32,190 --> 01:49:34,442
- Come on. 
- At 2345 last night...

1262
01:49:34,609 --> 01:49:38,780
...our sister arks, Numbers 6 and 7, 
have joined our course.

1263
01:49:40,323 --> 01:49:41,992
For the first time on ourjourney...

1264
01:49:42,158 --> 01:49:45,161
...we'll have clear skies 
and moderate-to-good air quality.

1265
01:49:45,328 --> 01:49:48,623
As you know, our passenger count 
is way over capacity.

1266
01:49:48,790 --> 01:49:51,251
So please be careful 
when you step out.

1267
01:49:51,418 --> 01:49:55,171
And of course, enjoy the fresh air.

1268
01:49:57,215 --> 01:49:58,341
Can I hold him?

1269
01:49:59,050 --> 01:50:01,678
Sure. He can be your dog too, 
if you like.

1270
01:50:01,845 --> 01:50:03,013
Thanks.

1271
01:50:07,100 --> 01:50:10,478
- Where have you been all my life? 
- Gift shop.

1272
01:51:07,327 --> 01:51:09,746
Oh, Adrian, excellent.

1273
01:51:10,163 --> 01:51:12,916
I called because we just got 
our first satellite feed.

1274
01:51:13,083 --> 01:51:15,585
The equalization 
of the oceanic seabeds...

1275
01:51:15,752 --> 01:51:18,254
...has not turned out 
to be as extreme as we expected.

1276
01:51:18,421 --> 01:51:22,092
The waters are receding much faster 
than we thought, thank God.

1277
01:51:22,258 --> 01:51:24,052
And this is hard to believe...

1278
01:51:24,219 --> 01:51:27,263
...but the Himalayas 
are no longer the roof of the world.

1279
01:51:27,430 --> 01:51:30,683
it's now the Drakensberg mountains 
of KwaZulu-Natal.

1280
01:51:30,850 --> 01:51:32,936
The entire African continent 
has risen.

1281
01:51:33,103 --> 01:51:36,064
Several thousand feet, 
and it likely never even flooded.

1282
01:51:36,231 --> 01:51:38,608
That's why they call it 
the Cape of Good Hope.

1283
01:51:38,775 --> 01:51:40,568
We've already set course for it.

1284
01:51:47,742 --> 01:51:49,661
Daddy, 
when will we go back home?

1285
01:51:50,495 --> 01:51:51,788
Well, we talked about that.

1286
01:51:51,955 --> 01:51:55,625
We're gonna find a new home 
out here somewhere, right?

1287
01:51:55,792 --> 01:51:58,545
I mean, wherever we're all together, 
that's home.

1288
01:51:58,712 --> 01:52:01,005
Right? Don't be scared.

1289
01:52:01,172 --> 01:52:02,799
I'm not.

1290
01:52:04,592 --> 01:52:06,136
No more Pull-Ups.

1291
01:52:09,472 --> 01:52:10,932
Nice.
