Where are you going?

170
00:13:46,283 --> 00:13:50,204
Yeah, this territory 
looks kinda familiar.

171
00:13:50,246 --> 00:13:52,456
Fabulous day in the canopy, isn't it?

172
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:55,876
- Where do you think you're goin'? 
- Mount Warning.

173
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:00,381
[Groggy] I know where I am. 
I know where I am.

174
00:14:00,422 --> 00:14:05,594
Hey! You scared me there. For a minute I thought 
you said you were going to Mount Warning.

175
00:14:05,678 --> 00:14:08,597
Well, I did.

176
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:13,394
- But there are humans on Mount Warning! 
- Exactly.

177

Fractured fig, fairy bug! 
Come on!

178
00:14:16,772 --> 00:14:21,861
Mount Warning is the last place in the 
world a little bug like you wants to go.

179
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,029
Look at these! 
You think nature did this?

180
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:26,699
Do you think I put this in 
to get better reception?

181
00:14:26,782 --> 00:14:28,993
No! Humans did this.

182
00:14:29,076 --> 00:14:32,705
We should stay here. 
It's nice here.

183
00:14:36,917 --> 00:14:41,130
Come on! You got a great set of wings. 
Let's just flutter for a while.

- My heart! Oh, my heart! 
- [Gasps]

188
00:15:00,983 --> 00:15:04,862
I can't go on. Help me! 
My little wings can't make it.

189
00:15:04,945 --> 00:15:07,698
Maybe you should wait here for me.

190
00:15:07,781 --> 00:15:10,910
This is a fabulous idea. 
I really think we should fly with that.

191
00:15:10,993 --> 00:15:13,787
Only, why don't you stay here with me?

192
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:16,707
It's okay, really. 
I'll be right back.

- [Yells] I'm fine.

199
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:30,906
- What is going on here? 
- The monster... it tried to eat you.

200
00:16:30,989 --> 00:16:34,451
- Monster? 
- My friend and I saved you.

Oh, Batty. Batty?

00:16:43,419 --> 00:16:47,464
Oh, sonic interference. 
What a nightmare.

204
00:16:47,548 --> 00:16:49,842
I thought I saw a human.

205
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:53,595
[Yells] Human!

206
00:16:54,680 --> 00:16:57,141
[Gasps] That's a human?

207
00:16:57,224 --> 00:17:00,477
Yes! Kill it! Restrain it!

- Don't worry! I've got it scared. 
- No! Stop!

212
00:17:11,447 --> 00:17:16,118
- I have but one claw, but beware. 
- Will you both just calm down?

[In Unison] He tried to kill you! 
I did not! You did!

214
00:17:19,955 --> 00:17:23,709
Hold on! The only thing 
that tried to kill anybody...

215
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:26,545
was that horrible monster 
in the forest.

216
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:29,298
"Monster"? What monster?

217
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,968
The one that ate the tree. 
It was terrible.

218
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:35,471
Tree?

219
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,473
The leveler.

220
00:17:37,556 --> 00:17:41,393

We could fix that for ya.

- Then I must be dreaming. 
- Nope.

223

Aw, sure. And what are you 
supposed to be... some kind of fairy?

224
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:56,116
Of course I am. What about you? 
Are you really a human?
